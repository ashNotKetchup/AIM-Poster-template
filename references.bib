	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) problem has been divided into two parts—an epistemological part and a heuristic part. This chapter further explains this division, explains some of the epistemological problems, and presents some new results and approaches. The epistemological part of AI studies what kinds of facts about the world are available to an observer with given opportunities to observe, how these facts can be represented in the memory of a computer, and what rules permit legitimate conclusions to be drawn from these facts. It leaves aside the heuristic problems of how to search spaces of possibilities and how to match patterns. Considering epistemological problems separately has the following advantages. (1) The same problems of what information is available to an observer and what conclusions can be drawn from information arise in connection with a variety of problem solving tasks. (2) A single solution of the epistemological problems can support a wide variety of heuristic approaches to a problem. (3) AI is a very difficult scientific problem, so there are great advantages in finding parts of the problem that can be separated out and separately attacked.},

This paper contributes an architectural perspective on presence design, exploring its potential to create architectural extensions that facilitate knowledge sharing and remote presence. With the example of a mediated therapist, taken from the author’s design-led research (Gullström 2010), the paper illustrates spatial design concepts (e.g. mediated gaze, spatial montage, shared mediated space), which, unaddressed, may be said to impose friction and thus impact negatively on the experience of witnessed mediatedpresence (Nevejan 2007). Mediated presence cannot be ensured by design; however, by acknowledging that certain features are related to spatial design, a presence designer can monitor them and, in effect, seek to reduce the ‘design friction’ that otherwise may inhibit, e.g., trust and knowledgesharing. It concludes that a presence-in-person paradigm prevails in our society, founded on the expectations of trust and knowledgesharing between individuals, and hereby addresses the contribution from presence design to architectural practice—as well as the reciprocal contribution from architecture to presence design—given that mediated spaces currently provide viable alternatives for meetings and interactions, hence with a fundamental impact on all human practices.},

By examining the act of listening as an alternative pathway and comparing the research, writings, and creative work of leaders of the acoustic ecology movement (i.e., R. Murray Schafer, Hildegard Westerkamp, and Bernie Krause), the author hopes to shed light on these potentials. For purposes of comparison, projects that explore the sonification and audification of inaudible signals will be examined, including the work of Christina Kubisch. The process of audification and sonification of these signals will be examined in comparison to soundscape experiences in order to develop a theory of data sonification based on the soundscape. In order to build a community around the urban soundscape, in 2003, the author co-founded the New York Society of Acoustic Ecology. Through this endeavor, she co-created the ongoing NYSoundmap and Sound Seeker projects, which provide some practical research for this article. Thus, by comparing and contrasting theoretical writings with leading listening exercises, public soundwalks, soundscape-related brainstorming sessions, and presenting field recordings in various settings, new methodologies will be documented.},

	abstract = {This paper pursues the intertwined tracks of robotics and art since the mid 20th century, taking a loose chronological approach that considers both the devices themselves and their discursive contexts. Relevant research has occurred in a variety of cultural locations, often outside of or prior to formalized robotics contexts. Research was even conducted under the aegis of art or cultural practices where robotics has been pursued for other than instrumental purposes. In hindsight, some of that work seems remarkably prescient of contemporary trends. The context of cultural robotics is a highly charged interdisciplinary test environment in which the theory and pragmatics of technical research confronts the phenomenological realities of physical and social being in the world, and the performative and processual practices of the arts. In this context, issues of embodiment, material instantiation, structural coupling, and machine sensing have provoked the reconsideration of notions of (machine) intelligence and cognitivist paradigms. The paradoxical condition of robotics vis-à-vis artificial intelligence is reflected upon. This paper discusses the possibility of a new embodied ontology of robotics that draws upon both cybernetics and post-cognitive approaches.},

Nonetheless, such an interest has neither given rise to a unitary approach nor to a shared debate. The primary goal of this paper is to map and synthetize the different existing perspectives to pave the way for an open discussion on the topic. The article is developed in two steps. In the first section, the authors analyze digital hermeneutics “in theory” by confronting and systematizing the existing literature. In particular, they stress three main distinctions among the approaches: (1) between “methodological” and “ontological” digital hermeneutics; (2) between data- and text-oriented digital hermeneutics; and (3) between “quantitative” and “qualitative” credos in digital hermeneutics. In the second section, they consider digital hermeneutics “in action”, by critically analyzing the uses of digital data (notably tweets) for studying a classical object such as the political opinion. In the conclusion, we will pave the way to an ontological turn in digital hermeneutics. Most of this article is devoted to the methodological issue of interpreting with digital machines. The main task of an ontological digital hermeneutics would consist instead in wondering if it is legitimate, and eventually to which extent, to speak of digital technologies, or at least of some of them, as interpretational machines.},

Our life with our equipment, which represents the “Ready-to-hand” in Heidegger's sense of the word, is determined by temporalization (Zeitigung) which cannot be separated and isolated from the wholeness of things in the world. In the second part of my paper, I explore the positive achievement of material hermeneutics (Don Ihde) with regard to its extension to technoscience and the discussion of how such hermeneutics can contribute to the preservation of our threatened lifeworld, but also to explore the possibilities of how technical inventions, medical innovations could improve our way of life.},

	abstract = {Usually technological innovation and artistic work are seen as very distinctive practices, and innovation of technologies is understood in terms of design and human intention. Moreover, thinking about technological innovation is usually categorized as “technical” and disconnected from thinking about culture and the social. Drawing on work by Dewey, Heidegger, Latour, and Wittgenstein and responding to academic discourses about craft and design, ethics and responsible innovation, transdisciplinarity, and participation, this essay questions these assumptions and examines what kind of knowledge and practices are involved in art and technological innovation. It argues that technological innovation is indeed “technical”, but, if conceptualized as techne, can be understood as art and performance. It is argued that in practice, innovative techne is not only connected to episteme as theoretical knowledge but also has the mode of poiesis: it is not just the outcome of human design and intention but rather involves a performative process in which there is a “dialogue” between form and matter and between creator and environment in which humans and non-humans participate. Moreover, this art is embedded in broader cultural patterns and grammars—ultimately a ‘form of life’—that shape and make possible the innovation. In that sense, there is no gap between science and society—a gap that is often assumed in STS and in, for instance, discourse on responsible innovation. It is concluded that technology and art were only relatively recently and unfortunately divorced, conceptually, but that in practices and performances they were always linked. If we understand technological innovation as a poetic, participative, and performative process, then bringing together technological innovation and artistic practices should not be seen as a marginal or luxury project but instead as one that is central, necessary, and vital for cultural-technological change. This conceptualization supports not only a different approach to innovation but has also social-transformative potential and has implications for ethics of technology and responsible innovation.},

First, we explore the role for morals, ethics, and other value systems in self-driving through a representative hypothetical dilemma faced by a self-driving car. Through the lens of engineering, we explain in simple terms common moral and ethical frameworks including utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics before characterizing their relationship to the fundamental algorithms enabling self-driving. The concepts of behavior cloning, state-based modeling, and reinforcement learning are introduced, with some algorithms being more suitable for the implementation of value systems than others. We touch upon the contemporary cross-disciplinary landscape of morals and ethics in self-driving systems from a joint philosophical and technical perspective, and close with considerations for practitioners and the public, particularly as individuals may not appreciate the nuance and complexity of using imperfect information to navigate diverse scenarios and tough-to-quantify value systems, while “typical” software development reduces complex problems to black and white decision-making.},

In this paper, we first discuss the AI value alignment from the relevant AI studies. Second, we briefly present what are material values and technological mediation and reflect on the AI value alignment through the lenses of these theories. We conclude that a set of finite human values can be defined and adapted to the stable life tasks that AI systems will be called upon to accomplish. The AI value alignment can also be fostered between designers and users through technological mediation. Upon that foundation, we propose a set of common principles to understand the AI value alignment through phenomenological theories.

	abstract = {The recent emergence of generative AI software as viable tools for use in the cultural and creative industries has sparked debates about the potential for “creativity” to be automated and “augmented” by algorithmic machines. Such discussions, however, begin from an ontological position, attempting to define creativity by either falling prey to universalism (i.e. “creativity is X”) or reductionism (i.e. “only humans can be truly creative” or “human creativity will be fully replaced by creative machines”). Furthermore, such an approach evades addressing the real and material impacts of AI on creative labour in these industries. This article thus offers more expansive methodological and conceptual approaches to the recent hype on generative AI. By combining (Csikszentmihalyi, The systems model of creativity, Springer, Dordrecht, 2014) systems view of creativity, in which we emphasise the shift from “what” to “where” is creativity, with (Lievrouw, Media technologies, The MIT Press, 2014) relational-materialist theory of “mediation”, we argue that the study of “creativity” in the context of generative AI must be attentive to the interactions between technologies, practices, and social arrangements. When exploring the relational space between these elements, three core concepts become pertinent: creative labour, automation, and distributed agency. Critiquing “creativity” through these conceptual lenses allows us to re-situate the use of generative AI within discourses of labour in post-industrial capitalism and brings us to a conceptualisation of creativity that privileges neither the human user nor machine algorithm but instead emphasises a relational and distributed form of agency.},

Transitioning to a circular economy (CE) model of development has been proposed as a sustainable alternative. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial enabler for CE. It can aid in designing robust and sustainable products, facilitate new circular business models, and support the broader infrastructures needed to scale circularity. However, to date, considerations of the ethical implications of using AI to achieve a transition to CE have been limited. This article addresses this gap. It outlines how AI is and can be used to transition towards CE, analyzes the ethical risks associated with using AI for this purpose, and supports some recommendations to policymakers and industry on how to minimise these risks.},

In order to establish this claim, I first argue that epistemic technologies can be conceptually and practically distinguished from other technologies in virtue of what they are designed for, what they do and how they do it. I then proceed to show that unlike other kinds of technology (including other epistemic technologies) AI can be uniquely positioned as an epistemic technology in that it is primarily designed, developed and deployed to be used in epistemic contexts such as inquiry, it is specifically designed, developed and deployed to manipulate epistemic content such as data, and it is designed, developed and deployed to do so particularly through epistemic operations such as prediction and analysis. As has been shown in recent work in the philosophy and ethics of AI (Alvarado, AI and Ethics, 2022a), understanding AI as an epistemic technology will also have significant implications for important debates regarding our relationship to AI technologies. This paper includes a brief overview of such implications, particularly those pertaining to explainability, opacity, trust and even epistemic harms related to AI technologies.},

Transparency and explainability, however, pertain to the technical domain and to philosophy of science, thus leaving the ethics and epistemology of AI largely disconnected. To remedy this, we propose an integrated approach premised on the idea that a glass-box epistemology should explicitly consider how to incorporate values and other normative considerations, such as intersectoral vulnerabilities, at critical stages of the whole process from design and implementation to use and assessment. To connect ethics and epistemology of AI, we perform a double shift of focus. First, we move from trusting the output of an AI system to trusting the process that leads to the outcome. Second, we move from expert assessment to more inclusive assessment strategies, aiming to facilitate expert and non-expert assessment. Together, these two moves yield a framework usable for experts and non-experts when they inquire into relevant epistemological and ethical aspects of AI systems. We dub our framework ‘epistemology-cum-ethics’ to signal the equal importance of both aspects. We develop it from the vantage point of the designers: how to create the conditions to internalize values into the whole process of design, implementation, use, and assessment of an AI system, in which values (epistemic and non-epistemic) are explicitly considered at each stage and inspectable by every salient actor involved at any moment.},

	abstract = {This paper considers recent experiments in art and artificial intelligence that crystallize around training algorithms to generate artworks based on datasets derived from the Western art historical canon. Over the last decade, a shift towards the rejection of canonicity has begun to take shape in art historical discourse. At the same time, algorithmically enabled practices in the US and Europe have emerged that entrench the Western canon as a locus and guarantor of aesthetic value. Operating within the epistemic framework of a “view from nowhere,” this tendency in generative art inherits the coloniality of both art history and artificial intelligence. Producing “art histories from nowhere,” this tendency conflates the conceptual category of visual art with the histories of Western cultural production. It reproduces a set of aesthetic values that entrench the mythology of the artist-genius and his imputed whiteness and masculinity; the extolment of innovation and novelty as self-evident virtues; disembodied Cartesian models of knowing and sensing; and the erasure of contributions that have been occluded from canonical visibility. As we encounter systems trained on particular visions of art history and of the artist, how might we remain attentive to the specific lens through which they are taught to see? This essay addresses that question by bringing the coloniality of recent experiments into view, bridging data feminisms and decolonial studies to formulate alternative visions of encounters between art and AI.},

Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1950). In the Mind paper, Turing asked a number of questions, including whether computers could ever be said to have the power of “thinking” (“I propose to consider the question, Can computers think?” ...Alan Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, Mind, 1950). Turing also set up a number of criteria—including his imitation game—under which a human could judge whether a computer could be said to be “intelligent”. Turing’s paper, as well as his important mathematical and computational insights of the 1930s and 1940s led to his popular acclaim as the “Father of Artificial Intelligence”. In the years since his paper was published, however, no computational system has fully satisfied Turing’s challenge. In this paper we focus on a different question, ignored in, but inspired by Turing’s work: How might the Artificial Intelligence practitioner implement “intelligence” on a computational device? Over the past 60 years, although the AI community has not produced a general-purpose computational intelligence, it has constructed a large number of important artifacts, as well as taken several philosophical stances able to shed light on the nature and implementation of intelligence. This paper contends that the construction of any human artifact includes an implicit epistemic stance. In AI this stance is found in commitments to particular knowledge representations and search strategies that lead to a product’s successes as well as its limitations. Finally, we suggest that computational and human intelligence are two different natural kinds, in the philosophical sense, and elaborate on this point in the conclusion.},

We maintain that the informativeness account limits its analysis to the impact of epistemological issues on ethical concerns without assessing the bearings that ethical features have on the epistemological evaluation of ML systems. We argue that according to this methodological approach, epistemological issues are instrumental to and autonomous of ethical considerations. This means that the informativeness account considers epistemological evaluation uninfluenced and unregulated by an ethical counterpart. Using an example that does not square well into the informativeness account, we argue for ethical assessments that have a substantial influence on the epistemological assessment of ML and that such influence should not be understood as merely informative but rather regulatory. Drawing on the case analyzed, we claim that within the theoretical framework of the informativeness approach, forms of epistemic injustice—especially epistemic objectification—remain unaddressed. Our analysis should motivate further research investigating the regulatory role that ethical elements play in the epistemology of ML.},

Notwithstanding the importance of epistemology of phenomena, the practicability cum philosophical aspects of machine learning needs to be seen in dynamic behaviour in socio-economic-technical value additions if human machine interaction processes that are context specific are incorporated into strong artificial intelligent systems. Cognitive Science is also studied from both computational and biological angles.

We identify conditions under which AI, by reducing the cost of access to certain modes of knowledge, can paradoxically harm public understanding. While large language models are trained on vast amounts of diverse data, they naturally generate output towards the ‘center’ of the distribution. This is generally useful, but widespread reliance on recursive AI systems could lead to a process we define as “knowledge collapse”, and argue this could harm innovation and the richness of human understanding and culture. However, unlike AI models that cannot choose what data they are trained on, humans may strategically seek out diverse forms of knowledge if they perceive them to be worthwhile. To investigate this, we provide a simple model in which a community of learners or innovators choose to use traditional methods or to rely on a discounted AI-assisted process and identify conditions under which knowledge collapse occurs. In our default model, a 20\% discount on AI-generated content generates public beliefs 2.3 times further from the truth than when there is no discount. An empirical approach to measuring the distribution of LLM outputs is provided in theoretical terms and illustrated through a specific example comparing the diversity of outputs across different models and prompting styles. Finally, we consider further research directions to counteract harmful outcomes.},

By reflecting on some cases, I shall try to argue that the most puzzling issue which engineers and philosophers should be aware that they have to jointly challenge may be that what we are actually doing through algorithmic automatisation is developing a novel human condition, according to which: (1) we are progressively thinking that algorithmic abstraction is always better than mental abstraction, because, at least in the Western culture, we come from a history of a progressive restriction of the best use of our minds to the realm of rationality, first, then to the realm of computation, second, and then to the realm of algorithmic automatisation, third, which finally exceeds our minds and (2) in doing so, we are progressively externalising not only human contents, but also human abilities, i.e., we are progressively atrophying ourselves, by becoming creatures who are progressively delegating the core of their very essence, which has always included the epistemological ability, together with the ethical courage, of making complex decisions on both our lives and the others’ lives.},

	abstract = {This paper delves into the intricate relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the art ecosystem, emphasizing the need for a decolonizing approach in the face of AI's growing influence. It argues that the development of AI is not just a technological leap but also a significant cultural and societal moment, akin to the advent of moving images that Walter Benjamin famously analyzed. The paper examines how AI, particularly in its current oligarchical and corporate-driven form, perpetuates and magnifies the existing social inequalities, thereby necessitating a critical and radical rethinking of its role in society and the arts. At the heart of the discussion is the concept of AI as a broad term encompassing various forms of machine intelligence, from natural language processing to computer vision. The paper criticizes the dominant anthropocentric view of intelligence and creativity, proposing a more inclusive approach that considers the diverse forms of intelligence present in other species and potentially in AI itself. It underscores the role of AI in shaping the art ecosystem, not just in the creative process but also in gatekeeping and decision-making. The paper proposes a framework for decolonizing AI in the art ecosystem, focusing on four key tasks: recognizing access as a form of power, understanding and addressing biases inherent in AI, assessing the impact of AI on marginalized communities, and challenging dominant narratives and epistemologies to create space for alternative voices and perspectives. It emphasizes the need for artists and the art community to engage actively with AI, shaping its development towards more equitable and just outcomes. In conclusion, the paper calls for a radical reimagination of AI's role in society and the arts, advocating for a future where AI is not just about technological advancement but also about fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and creatively diverse world. It invites artists, thinkers, and innovators to join in this journey of reimagining and reshaping the future of AI and the art ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Although true in some aspects, the suggested characterization of today’s science as a dichotomy between traditional science and data-driven science misses some of the nuance, complexity, and possibility that exists between the two positions. Part of the problem is the claim that Data Science works without theories. There are many theories behind the data that are used in science. However, for data science, the only theories that matter are those in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. In this conceptual paper, we add two other philosophy of science tenets, experiments and data, to the discussion to create a more nuanced view of how data science uses theories. Following Ihde’s concept of technoscience and the incessant quest for more precision, magnification, and resolution, we argue that technology-driven science created a need for more technology-driven science, culminating in data science. Further, we adapt Hacking and Galison’s views on physics to argue that data science is also an experimental science, which uses data objects in experiments. Drawing from Heelan (The Journal of Philosophy 85:515–524, 1988), we called these objects “data-objects-for-knowing”. Finally, we conclude that data science is a science to study artificially created phenomena—a science to study the data manipulated by the equations and operations of AI. It disregards the connections between data and the real world that were carefully built by the theories from other sciences. In the experiments of data science, data are the world itself. The knowledge created by data science is purposely disconnected from any theory from other sciences; it is a knowledge for the sake of itself.},

	abstract = {The current trajectory of artificial intelligence development suffers from fundamental epistemological shortcomings, resulting in the systematic operationalization of bias against non-white, non-male, and non-Western peoples. We argue that these failings are, in part, the result of certain Western rationalist epistemologies that exclude many ways of knowing about the world, and therefore they cannot provide a sufficient foundation on which to adequately, robustly, and humanely conceptualize intelligence. We present a new research agenda, Abundant Intelligences, an Indigenous-led, Indigenous-majority international, interdisciplinary research program that imagines anew how to conceptualize and design artificial intelligence (AI) based on Indigenous knowledge (IK) systems. Abundant Intelligences draws on the rich plurality of Indigenous knowledge systems, bringing together diverse sets of thought, culture, and protocol together. We show IK systems provide one way to rebuild AI’s epistemological foundations and transform these tools’ current role in reinforcing colonial practices of exclusion, extraction, manipulation, and eradication into engines of abundance that enable us to care better for ourselves, our communities, and our world. Our proposition is to fully engage with AI to explore how different conceptions of intelligence could be embodied in these technologies. In this paper, we present the tenets of the research program in detail, account for our methodological approach, describe the impact and limitations, and conclude on a discussion of the implications of the program.},

In this scenario, this article presents a reflection on the two epistemological aspects faced by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) The epistemological aspect resulting from the use of patient data to fill the knowledge base of intelligent systems; (2) the epistemological problem arising from the dependence of health professionals on the results/diagnoses issued by intelligent systems.

	abstract = {This article will rework the classical question ‘Can a machine think?’ into a more specific problem: ‘Can a machine think anything new?’ It will consider traditional computational tasks such as prediction and decision-making, so as to investigate whether the instrumentality of these operations can be understood in terms of the creation of novel thought. By addressing philosophical and technoscientific attempts to mechanise thought on the one hand (e.g. Leibniz’s mathesis universalis and Turing’s algorithmic method of computation), and the philosophical and cultural critique of these attempts on the other, I will argue that computation’s epistemic productions should be assessed vis-à-vis the logico-mathematical specificity of formal axiomatic systems. Such an assessment requires us to conceive automated modes of thought in such a way as to supersede the hope that machines might replicate human cognitive faculties, and to thereby acknowledge a form of onto-epistemological autonomy in automated ‘thinking’ processes. This involves moving beyond the view that machines might merely simulate humans. Machine thought should be seen as dramatically alien to human thought, and to the dimension of lived experience upon which the latter is predicated. Having stepped outside the simulative paradigm, the question ‘Can a machine think anything new?’ can then be reformulated. One should ask whether novel behaviour in computing might come not from the breaking of mechanical rules, but from following them: from doing what computers do already, and not what we might think they should be doing if we wanted them to imitate us.},

	abstract = {The present paper shows how statistical learning theory and machine learning models can be used to enhance understanding of AI-related epistemological issues regarding inductive reasoning and reliability of generalisations. Towards this aim, the paper proceeds as follows. First, it expounds Price’s dual image of representation in terms of the notions of e-representations and i-representations that constitute subject naturalism. For Price, this is not a strictly anti-representationalist position but rather a dualist one (e- and i-representations). Second, the paper links this debate with machine learning in terms of statistical learning theory becoming more viable epistemological tool when it abandons the perspective of object naturalism. The paper then argues that machine learning grounds a form of knowing that can be understood in terms of e- and i-representation learning. Third, this synthesis shows a way of analysing inductive reasoning in terms of reliability of generalisations stemming from a structure of e- and i-representations. In the age of Artificial Intelligence, connecting Price’s dual view of representation with Deep Learning provides an epistemological way forward and even perhaps an approach to how knowing is possible.},

Written in 1932, this novel employs a satirical yet cautionary tone, utilizing rich, ironic prose to explore the loss of individuality in a society driven by consumerism, genetic engineering, and hedonism. Huxley crafts a technologically advanced world where human beings are conditioned from birth to embrace a predetermined social order, raising profound ethical questions about freedom, happiness, and the cost of progress. Aldous Huxley, a member of a prominent scientific family, was deeply influenced by both the Enlightenment ideals of progress and the emerging anxieties of the early 20th century. His exposure to the early theories of psychology, biology, and the effects of totalitarianism shaped his critical perspective on modern civilization. "Brave New World" serves as both a product of its time and a prophetic warning, reflecting Huxley's concerns about the dehumanizing potential of technological advancement and the inherent risks of sacrificing individuality for societal stability. This landmark work is an essential read for anyone interested in the interplay between technology, society, and human values. Huxley's masterful narrative invites readers to reflect on the moral dilemmas of contemporary life, making it a timeless exploration of the balance between progress and humanity.

	abstract = {Musical instruments are not static and neutral technological objects, but objects we shape through our designing and performing practices. Along these lines, various authors have argued for the relevance of practice research in the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) field. Most of these contributions tackle interface evaluation or issues related to musical practice. In contrast, technical processes are typically addressed from linear, goal-oriented narratives based on technical implementation that consider the instrument merely as a technical artefact. In this paper, we critique such technoscientific narratives through science and technology studies, human-computer interaction, design and NIME literature. We propose Technical Practice Research as an alternative mode of research in technical practice that places the locus of knowledge production in the practice rather than the technical artefact, by focussing on the first-person and real-time nature of technical practice. Although framed in the context of NIME, this proposal extends to other fields in which technical and creative practice are intertwined.},

	abstract = {A social history of AI that finally reveals its roots in the spatial computation of industrial factories and the surveillance of collective behaviour.What is AI? A dominant view describes it as the quest "to solve intelligence," a solution supposedly to be found in the secret logic of the mind or in the deep physiology of the brain, such as in its complex neural networks.The Eye of the Master argues, to the contrary, that the inner code of AI is shaped not by the imitation of biological intelligence, but the intelligence of labour and social relations, as it is found in Babbage's "calculating engines" of the industrial age as well as in the recent algorithms for image recognition and surveillance.The idea that AI may one day become autonomous (or "sentient", as someone thought of Google's LaMDA) is pure fantasy. Computer algorithms have always imitated the form of social relations and the organisation of labour in their own inner structure and their purpose remains blind automation.The Eye of the Master urges a new literacy on AI for scientists, journalists and new generations of activists, who should recognise that the "mystery" of AI is just the automation of labour at the highest degree, not intelligence per se.},

This paper offers a comprehensive case study of The Zizi Show, by Jake Elwes, developed as part of The New Real and Experiential AI programme at the Edinburgh Futures Institute within the University of Edinburgh. Based on this case study analysis, we propose the structuring of distinct project characteristics into four categories (socio-cultural and institutional aspects; technology and media; experience and affect; and audience and impact) which form the basis for a heuristic model. The statements/descriptors collected in each category serve to capture creative and design strategies that can lead design processes from cultural and technological perspectives, enable projects’ cross-examination and evaluation and surface blindspots in the creative process.},

	abstract = {Seeking new forms of expression in computer music, a small number of laptop composers are braving the challenges of coding music on the fly. Not content to submit meekly to the rigid interfaces of performance software like Ableton Live or Reason, they work with programming languages, building their own custom software, tweaking or writing the programs themselves as they perform. Often this activity takes place within some established language for computer music like SuperCollider, but there is no reason to stop errant minds pursuing their innovations in general scripting languages like Perl. This paper presents an introduction to the field of live coding, of real-time scripting during laptop music performance, and the improvisatory power and risks involved. We look at two test cases, the command-line music of slub utilising, amongst a grab-bag of technologies, Perl and REALbasic, and Julian Rohrhuber's Just In Time library for SuperCollider. We try to give a flavour of an exciting but hazardous world at the forefront of live laptop performance.},

In particular, the article argues for a rhythmanalysis of the sonic event as a ‘vibrating sensation’ (Deleuze and Guattari) that incorporates the virtual without necessarily actualizing it. Picking up on notions such as rhythm, time, affect, and event, particularly through their discussion in relation to Susanne Langer’s work, I argue for the consideration of the sonic event as an instance of a different kind of temporality subsisting underneath clock-time and sense perception. Ultimately, and this is the position of this essay, an investigation into experimental projects that interweave digital, sound, and aesthetic dimensions enables the articulation of a rhythmic time that helps account for the unknown, indeterminate, and unintentional forces immanent to the sonic.},

The word ‘Robot’ is derived from the Czech robota meaning ‘drudgery’ or ‘servitude’; a robotnik is Czech for both worker and serf or peasant. (Robot is always capitalized, since it is a trade-marked brand name.) R.U.R. enjoyed enough cultural capital that the play introduced the word Robot into the lexicon. The R.U.R. factory, an early-adopter of acronyms (R.U.R. stands for Rossum’s Universal Robots), is located on a remote island in the future where Robot workers are manufactured. (A poster from the Prague production listed the year as 2000, although the date is never specified in any version of the script.) An island setting is traditional for both science fiction and utopian literature: think of Thomas More’s Utopia, Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, or H. G. Wells’s Island of Dr Moreau. But like most utopian literature of the twentieth century, the world of R.U.R. is distinctly dystopian. Over the decade that passes during the course of the play, Robots replace human beings as workers in all areas of industry, including in the military. These replacement Robots allow humans the ultimate leisure time. However, certain Robots are surreptitiously given larger brains.},

	abstract = {The original aim of this professional Doctor of Creative Industries (DCI) Research Project was to investigate music-making practice and Self as a practitioner in the process of creating and producing a DIY music artifact. Specifically: to investigate why I as the practitioner felt a connection with one form of music-making (acoustic instrument-based), and not a connection with another form of music-making (digital virtual-based). As a phenomenologist, I situated Self into this auto-ethnographic study in the dual roles of researcher and practitioner; developing first-person narratives of my personal journey, critical reflection and reflexive practice. The holistic and multi-dimensional nature of this research has provided rich and nuanced data, illuminating the co-constituted nature of Self, interpreting meaning, and practice. In particular, the research study contextualises contemporary DIY creative practice relative to three interdependent tenets: music \&amp; sound-making practice, meaning-making and Self-making, where these tenets are understood in terms of hybridity, agency and subjectivity.},

Never before have people had access to so much music and in so many different ways and with so many different patterns of use. This paper examines some of the effects of recording on listening, starting with a brief outline of an ecological theory of listening and focusing on three specific characteristics of recordings: the interpenetration of music and the wider environment; recordings as medium and as object; and the relationship between social and solitary listening practices. Recording has attracted both utopian and dystopian commentaries on its effects on musical culture, and the paper concludes by considering both the opportunities and the drawbacks of recordings as a means of access to music.},

How did this rapid explosion of ideas impact upon the evolution of new disciplines?The Renaissance Computer looks at the fascinating development of new methods of information storage and retrieval which took place at the very beginning of print culture. And it asks some crucial questions about the intellectual conditions of our own digital age. A dazzling array of leading experts in Renaissance culture explore topics of urgent significance today, including: * the contribution of knowledge technologies to state formulation and national identity*the effect of multimedia, orality and memory on education*the importance of the visual display of information and how search engines reflect and direct ways of thinking.},

The article focuses on the similarities between Schelling’s notion of nature’s productivity and Adorno’s understanding of natural beauty. It concludes with a discussion on Adorno’s re-evaluation of the reconciliatory power of the exemplary unity of the artwork in conjunction with Schelling’s comparison between artwork and organism, as well as his concept of the construction of nature.},

Now is the time to interpret technosocial mediation from a range of disciplinary perspectives, rather than settling on a narrow canon of literature. To this end, our paper enacts a diffractive dialogue between researchers from different disciplines, focusing on digital musical instruments to examine how technical knowledge from design and engineering can be read against the grain of critical theories from music, media, and cultural studies. Drawing on two object lessons—keyboards and step sequencers, plus their remediations in recent musical interaction research—we highlight interdependencies of theory, design, and practice, and we show how the idea of entanglement is itself entangled in a cross-disciplinary web.},

The authors conducted a series of interviews with technologists, science fiction writers, and other experts, as well as a workshop, to identify a set of key themes relevant to the near future of AI. In parallel, they led the analysis of almost 100 recent works of science fiction stories with AI themes to develop a preliminary taxonomy of AI in science fiction. These activities informed the commissioning of six original works of science fiction and non-fiction response essays on the themes of “intelligence” and “justice” that were published as part of the Slate Future Tense Fiction series in 2019 and 2020. Our findings indicate that artificial intelligence remains deeply ambiguous both in the policy and cultural contexts: we struggle to define the boundaries and the agency of machine intelligence, and consequently find it difficult to govern or interact with such systems. However, our findings also suggest more productive avenues of inquiry and framing that could foster both better policy and better narratives around AI.},

	abstract = {End-to-end deep learning models are increasingly applied to safety-critical human activity recognition (HAR) applications, e.g., healthcare monitoring and smart home control, to reduce developer burden and increase the performance and robustness of prediction models. However, integrating HAR models in safety-critical applications requires trust, and recent approaches have aimed to balance the performance of deep learning models with explainable decision-making for complex activity recognition. Prior works have exploited the compositionality of complex HAR (i.e., higher-level activities composed of lower-level activities) to form models with symbolic interfaces, such as concept-bottleneck architectures, that facilitate inherently interpretable models. However, feature engineering for symbolic concepts-as well as the relationship between the concepts-requires precise annotation of lower-level activities by domain experts, usually with fixed time windows, all of which induce a heavy and error-prone workload on the domain expert. In this paper, we introduce X-CHAR, an eXplainable Complex Human Activity Recognition model that doesn't require precise annotation of low-level activities, offers explanations in the form of human-understandable, high-level concepts, while maintaining the robust performance of end-to-end deep learning models for time series data. X-CHAR learns to model complex activity recognition in the form of a sequence of concepts. For each classification, X-CHAR outputs a sequence of concepts and a counterfactual example as the explanation. We show that the sequence information of the concepts can be modeled using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss without having accurate start and end times of low-level annotations in the training dataset-significantly reducing developer burden. We evaluate our model on several complex activity datasets and demonstrate that our model offers explanations without compromising the prediction accuracy in comparison to baseline models. Finally, we conducted a mechanical Turk study to show that the explanations provided by our model are more understandable than the explanations from existing methods for complex activity recognition.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

Bomba is an ancient genre of resistance from Puerto Rico created by enslaved people on the island over 400 years ago. Recently, bomba music has been a staple of Black Lives Matter protests calling back to its roots as a music of resilience. Together, hosts Linda Diaz and LA Buckner break down the musical and cultural elements that make bomba, bomba. Ivelisse Diaz of Bomba con Buya teaches Linda about bomba singing, and LA learns bomba drum rhythms.

	abstract = {AI technologies have been incorporated into many end-user applications. However, expectations of the capabilities of such systems vary among people. Furthermore, bloated expectations have been identified as negatively affecting perception and acceptance of such systems. Although the intelligibility of ML algorithms has been well studied, there has been little work on methods for setting appropriate expectations before the initial use of an AI-based system. In this work, we use a Scheduling Assistant - an AI system for automated meeting request detection in free-text email - to study the impact of several methods of expectation setting. We explore two versions of this system with the same 50\% level of accuracy of the AI component but each designed with a different focus on the types of errors to avoid (avoiding False Positives vs. False Negatives). We show that such different focus can lead to vastly different subjective perceptions of accuracy and acceptance. Further, we design expectation adjustment techniques that prepare users for AI imperfections and result in a significant increase in acceptance.},

Recent work has drawn attention to the emergent explainability requirements of in situ, applied projects, yet further exploratory work is needed to more fully understand this space. This paper investigates applied AI projects and reports on a qualitative interview study of individuals working on AI projects at a large technology and consulting company. Presenting an empirical understanding of the range of stakeholders in industrial AI projects, this paper also draws out the emergent explainability practices that arise as these projects unfold, highlighting the range of explanation audiences (who), as well as how their explainability needs evolve across the AI project lifecycle (when). We discuss the importance of adopting a sociotechnical lens in designing AI systems, noting how the “AI lifecycle” can serve as a design metaphor to further the XAI design field.},

The work flow involves development of the code base in C++, making use of all the facilities available to C++ programmers, then transpiling to asm.js bytecode, using Emscripten to allow use of the libraries in web browsers. Audio capabilities are provided via the C++ Maximilian library that is transpiled and connected to the Web Audio API, via the ScriptProcessorNode. Machine learning is provided via the RapidLib library which implements neural networks, k-NN and Dynamic Time Warping for regression and classification tasks. An online, browser-based IDE is the final part of the system, making the toolkit available for education and rapid prototyping purposes, without requiring software other than a web browser. Two example use cases are described: rapid prototyping of novel, electronic instruments and education. Finally, an evaluation of the performance of the libraries is presented, showing that they perform acceptably well in the web browser, compared to the native counterparts but there is room for improvement here. The system is being used by thousands of students in our on-campus and online courses.},

	title = {“{Worker}, build your own machinery!” {A} workshop to practice the {Technological} {Disobedience}.},
	abstract = {This paper presents an account of the experience of a workshop with title "Worker, build your own machinery!", held at Politecnico di Milano. The title of the workshop refers to a Ernesto Che Guevara’s quote in a 1961 speech: as the Republic of Cuba’s Minister of Industry, his aim was en-couraging Cuban workers and technicians to face the scarcity of resources due to the country’s eco-nomical and political crisis. The general approach he suggested to address this issue was self-production of the spare parts required for productive activities: this would involve a number of strate-gies, such as repair, reuse and repurpose. Self-production included a drive towards the re-appropriation of technologies, suitably combining mass-production and handicraft tools. Over time, these practices became common not only in the field of industrial production, but also in everyday life. This workshop was directly inspired by the research work of Ernesto Oroza, designer and Cuban art-ist, who studied the changes that 50 years of isolation produced on the island’s materiality. The first part of the paper introduces and explains the theoretical concepts on which the workshop was based, whereas the second part exposes and discusses the obtained outcomes. This will include a reflection over the role of design and designers facing the deep social, economic and technological changes we are presently experimenting. These considerations will be aimed at encouraging future designers, emphasising the importance of their educational role and providing inspiration regarding issues, such as repair, reuse and repurpose, which are all essential for a sustainable approach.},

While some critics have embraced Kanye’s brash political commentary on race (Nigatu, 2013), many academics have mobilized an intersectional moralization, pitting his very real material account of the racism that Blacks, especially Black men, suffer against his sexual engagement with women. From being called a violent misogynist (Shird, 2013) to sex crazed (Johnston, 2013), Black progressives and feminists echoing the haloed/hollowed values of their respective disciplinary/political ideologies—ideologies that offer little to nothing to Black Americans, especially the worsening plight of Black men—have condemned Kanye West’s message as little more than the patriarchal ramblings of a power-hungry deviant. Such a condemnation, which exceeds the utility of a corrective criticism, does not aim to transform or interpret Kanye’s sentiments to more ameliorative ends, but rather seeks to eliminate such sentiments because they allegedly come from a pathological/immoral/Black/masculine mind.1 Unlike much of the academic criticism that claims to be in the business of antiracism and critical of white supremacy, but is nonetheless approved of by white journals, white readers, and white colleagues, West completely disregards the morality that sustains the academic’s loyalty to the preapproved disciplinary rhetoric used to convey disdain, and the bourgeois lexicon of academic pretense created to criticize oppression and social inequity.},

	abstract = {Adrono's jazz essays have attracted considerable notoriety not only for their negative and dismissive evaluation of jazz as music but for their outright dismissal of all the claims made on behalf of jazz by its exponents and admirers, even of claims concerning the black origins of jazz music. This paper offers a critical exposition of Adorno's views on jazz and outlines an alternative theory of the culture industry as the basis of a critique of Adorno's critical theory. Adorno's arguments are discussed in the context of his wider theoretical commitment to a model of structuration-in both musical and social relations-that establishes a dividing line between a moral aesthetic praxis that can be approved as having "truth-value" and one that betrays and subverts the truth. In Adorno's analysis, jazz finds itself positioned on the wrong side of that line and, accordingly, is condemned. It is argued that it is Adorno's commitment to a formalist model of art works that has been superseded by modern aesthetic practice in both so-called "serious" art as well as in the works of the culture industries that binds him to a regressive model of aesthetic praxis. An alternative theory of the culture industry is outlined that explores its positive functions in enhancing the resources available for culture creation through its transmission of aesthetic codes, and in mediating relations between so-called high and low art.},

These include highly expressive materials like sensors, displays, micro-controllers, etc. This workshop will explore processes in creative making with e-waste, examining the unique materiality of e-waste and how its reuse differs and/or converges with other material reuse processes. To do so, our workshop will combine hands-on activities (tear downs, rapid prototyping, and tutorials) with discussion of the challenges and opportunities in this space.

In this paper we take stock of the literature on ecologies et al. in HCI and CSCW with the aim of identifying key positions, differences, similarities, and sub-concepts, as well as opportunities moving forward. From a reviewed corpus of 129 publications we consolidate 54 concepts into four influential positions and identify cross-cutting themes, conceptual gaps and challenges moving forward. In addition, we discuss issues related to the disconnected nature and theoretical quality of the concepts and how that impacts implicit theorising within our research community.},

In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

Many of the methods used in participatory research are drawn from mainstream disciplines and conventional research itself involves varying degrees of participation. The key difference between participatory and conventional methodologies lies in the location of power in the research process. We review some of the participatory methodologies which are currently being popularized in health research, focusing on the issue of control over the research process. Participatory research raises personal, professional and political challenges which go beyond the bounds of the production of information.

One of the main research lines in XAI is post-hoc explainability, the task of explaining the logic of an already deployed black-box model. This is usually achieved by learning an interpretable surrogate function that approximates the black box. Among the existing explanation paradigms, local linear explanations are one of the most popular due to their simplicity and fidelity. Despite their advantages, linear surrogates may not always be the most adapted method to produce reliable, i.e., unambiguous and faithful explanations. Hence, this paper introduces Adapted Post-hoc Explanations (APE), a novel method that characterizes the decision boundary of a black-box classifier and identifies when a linear model constitutes a reliable explanation. Besides, characterizing the black-box frontier allows us to provide complementary counterfactual explanations. Our experimental evaluation shows that APE identifies accurately the situations where linear surrogates are suitable while also providing meaningful counterfactual explanations.},

	abstract = {Large-scale diffusion neural networks represent a substantial milestone in text-to-image generation, with some performing similar to real photographs in human evaluation. However, they remain poorly understood, lacking explainability and interpretability analyses, largely due to their proprietary, closed-source nature. In this paper, to shine some much-needed light on text-to-image diffusion models, we perform a text-image attribution analysis on Stable Diffusion, a recently open-sourced large diffusion model. To produce pixel-level attribution maps, we propose DAAM, a novel method based on upscaling and aggregating cross-attention activations in the latent denoising subnetwork. We support its correctness by evaluating its unsupervised semantic segmentation quality on its own generated imagery, compared to supervised segmentation models. We show that DAAM performs strongly on COCO caption-generated images, achieving an mIoU of 61.0, and it outperforms supervised models on open-vocabulary segmentation, for an mIoU of 51.5. We further find that certain parts of speech, like punctuation and conjunctions, influence the generated imagery most, which agrees with the prior literature, while determiners and numerals the least, suggesting poor numeracy. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose and study word-pixel attribution for interpreting large-scale diffusion models. Our code and data are at https://github.com/castorini/daam.},

	abstract = {Background in musical improvisation and creativity. What makes musical improvisation creative? And what exactly is it that justifies one improviser being described as more creative than another? For a clearer understanding, it is a practical necessity to use an approach such as those of Berliner (1994) and Gibbs (2010), who make the study of improvisational creativity more tangible by identifying key constituent parts, rather than treat creativity as ineffable (Bailey 1993). Background in computational linguistics. The log likelihood ratio statistic can be used to compare two sets of texts (corpora) to examine word distribution patterns (Rayson \& Garside 2000, Dunning 1993). Using this statistic, words are identified which are associated with academic papers on creativity. Lin’s similarity measure (Lin 1998) is then used as a basis for clustering words with similar meanings using the algorithm Chinese Whispers (Biemann 2006). Analysis of the clusters reveals fourteen key components of creativity. Aims. To model creativity in musical improvisation by identifying components of creativity using computational linguistics techniques and understanding how each contributes to creativity in improvisation. Main contribution. The paper presents an empirical, language-based approach to understanding creativity in musical improvisation. This approach is based upon treating creativity as having common features that transcend different types of creativity but that vary in importance depending on the type of creativity. Fourteen key components of creativity are identified from an analysis of a corpus of texts on creativity. A study is then conducted to investigate the relative importance of each of these components in musical improvisational. All fourteen components are considered relevant to some degree, but particular significance is attached to three of them: the ability to communicate and interact, the possession of relevant musical knowledge and skills, and emotional engagement and intention. It is notable that the products of improvisation are relatively less important than these process-based aspects. Implications. The work provides a model of musical improvisational creativity as a set of guidelines or benchmarks for evaluating how creative a musical improviser is. Such a detailed understanding helps improvisers identify what areas to work on in order to develop their creativity (Gibbs 2010).},

	abstract = {What Ever Happened to Anti-Essentialism?
How should one explain the relative disappearance of a major preoccupation of English-speaking Analytical Philosophy in the late 1950s/early 1960s: an anti-essentialist response to the question, ‘What is art?’, typified in papers by Kennick and Weitz? Minimally, anti-essentialism denies the widely-held assumption that something must be in common between all the instances where (in our case) the term “[fine] art” or the concept art is rightly ascribed, in virtue of which all are called ‘art’; a stronger version urges that, in fact, there is no essence to (our example) art.
         With counter-arguments typically not forthcoming, Carroll (2000) mentions both Danto’s institutionalism and Mandelbaum’s assault on the notion of family resemblance, to explain the slackening of concern for such neo-Wittgensteinian issues. Consideration of the actual arguments by Kennick and Weitz highlights their unjustified dependence on Waismann’s notion of open texture, where recognizing a clearer application of Wittgenstein’s ideas retains that central, if minimal, anti-essentialist thrust for Kennick and Weitz, thereby returning this issue to the forefront of aesthetic theorizing.},

	abstract = {Walter Benjamin's importance as a philosopher and criticaltheorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influenceand the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as aliterary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis ofBenjamin's writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were adecisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno's conception ofphilosophy's actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).In the 1930s, Benjamin's efforts to develop a politicallyoriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulusfor both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poetand dramatist Bertolt Brecht.  , The delayed appearance of Benjamin's collected writings has determinedand sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volumeselection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition notappearing until 1972–89; English anthologies first appeared in1968 and 1978; the four-volume Selected Writings,1996–2003.) Originally received in the context of literarytheory and aesthetics, the philosophical depth and cultural breadth ofBenjamin's thought have only recently begun to be fullyappreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literaturethat it has produced, his work remains a continuing source ofproductivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his workhas contributed to the philosophical revival of Early GermanRomanticism. His essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of ItsTechnical Reproducibility’ remains a major theoretical text forfilm theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from hisunfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The ArcadesProject), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory andphilosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin's messianicunderstanding of history has been an enduring source of theoreticalfascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophicalthinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in acritical context, Jürgen Habermas. The ‘Critique ofViolence’ and ‘On the Concept of History’ areimportant sources for Derrida's discussion of messianicity, which hasbeen influential, along with Paul de Man's discussion of allegory, forthe poststructuralist reception of Benjamin's writings. Aspects ofBenjamin's thought have also been associated with a revival ofpolitical theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true tothe tendencies of Benjamin's own political thought. More recently,interest in Benjamin’s philosophy of education has been fueled by thetranslations of his Early Writings in 2011 and thetranscripts of his radio broadcasts for children (RadioBenjamin) in 2014.},

	abstract = {Electrical and electronic waste is a growing problem as volumes are increasing fast. Rapid product innovation and replacement, especially in information and communication technologies (ICT), combined with the migration from analog to digital technologies and to flat-screen televisions and monitors has resulted in some electronic products quickly reaching the end of their life. The EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) aims to minimise WEEE by putting organizational and financial responsibility on producers and distributors for collection, treatment, recycling and recovery of WEEE. Therefore all stakeholders need to be well-informed about their WEEE responsibilities and options. While focussing on the EU, this book draws lessons for policy and practice from all over the world. Part one introduces the reader to legislation and initiatives to manage WEEE. Part two discusses technologies for the refurbishment, treatment and recycling of waste electronics. Part three focuses on electronic products that present particular challenges for recyclers. Part four explores sustainable design of electronics and supply chains. Part five discusses national and regional WEEE management schemes and part six looks at corporate WEEE management strategies. With an authoritative collection of chapters from an international team of authors, Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) handbook is designed to be used as a reference by policy-makers, producers and treatment operators in both the developed and developing world. Draws lessons for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) policy and practice from around the worldDiscusses legislation and initiatives to manage WEEE, including global e-waste initiatives, EU legislation relating to electronic waste, and eco-efficiency evaluation of WEEE take-back systemsSections cover technologies for refurbishment, treatment and recycling of waste, sustainable design of electronics and supply chains, national and regional waste management schemes, and corporate WEEE management strategies.},

Here, we surveyed 36 of such knowledge organization systems, which we identified through a systematic literature search. To evaluate the semantic domains covered by these systems within a homogeneous framework, we introduced a comprehensive set of verbal sound descriptors (sound source properties; attributes of sensation; sound signal descriptors; onomatopoeias; music genres), which we used to manually label the surveyed descriptor classes. We reveal that most taxonomies and ontologies were developed to characterize higher-level semantic relations between sound sources in terms of the sound-generating objects and actions involved (what/how), or in terms of the environmental context (where). This indicates the current lack of a comprehensive ontology of everyday sounds that covers simultaneously all semantic aspects of the relation between sounds. Such an ontology may have a wide range of applications and purposes, ranging from extending our scientific knowledge of auditory processes in the real world, to developing artificial hearing systems.},

However, the usability of those tools remains moderate due to the problems in understanding rich language variations in human commands, along with efficiency and comprehensibility issues. Therefore, we introduce Voicify, an Android virtual assistant that allows users to interact with on-screen elements in mobile apps through voice commands. Using a novel deep learning command parser, Voicify interprets human verbal input and performs matching with UI elements. In addition, the tool can directly open a specific feature from installed applications by fetching application code information to explore the set of in-app components. Our command parser achieved 90\% accuracy on the human command dataset. Furthermore, the direct feature invocation module achieves better feature coverage in comparison to Google Assistant. The user study demonstrates the usefulness of Voicify in real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {Visual body signals are designated body poses that deliver an application-specific message. Such signals are widely used for fast message communication in sports (signaling by umpires and referees), transportation (naval officers and aircraft marshallers), and construction (signaling by riggers and crane operators), to list a few examples. Automatic interpretation of such signals can help maintaining safer operations in these industries, help in record-keeping for auditing or accident investigation purposes, and function as a score-keeper in sports. When automation of these signals is desired, it is traditionally performed from a viewer's perspective by running computer vision algorithms on camera feeds. However, computer vision based approaches suffer from performance deterioration in scenarios such as lighting variations, occlusions, etc., might face resolution limitations, and can be challenging to install. Our work, ViSig, breaks with tradition by instead deploying on-body sensors for signal interpretation. Our key innovation is the fusion of ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors for capturing on-body distance measurements, inertial sensors (IMU) for capturing orientation of a few body segments, and photodiodes for finger signal recognition, enabling a robust interpretation of signals. By deploying only a small number of sensors, we show that body signals can be interpreted unambiguously in many different settings, including in games of Cricket, Baseball, and Football, and in operational safety use-cases such as crane operations and flag semaphores for maritime navigation, with {\textgreater} 90\% accuracy. Overall, we have seen substantial promise in this approach and expect a large body of future follow-on work to start using UWB and IMU fused modalities for the more general human pose estimation problems.},

Existing studies demonstrate the feasibility of applying learning-based solutions on built-in sensor measurements to recover voices. However, due to the privacy concerns, large-scale voices-sensor measurements samples for model training are not publicly available, leading to significant efforts in data collection for such an attack. In this paper, we propose a training-free and universal eavesdropping attack on built-in speakers, VoiceListener, which releases the data collection efforts and is able to adapt to various voices, platforms, and domains. In particular, VoiceListener develops an aliasing-corrected super resolution mechanism, including an aliasing-based pitch estimation and an aliasing-corrected voice recovering, to convert the undersampled narrow-band sensor measurements to wide-band voices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed VoiceListener could accurately recover the voices from undersampled sensor measurements and is robust to different voices, platforms and domains, realizing the universal eavesdropping attack.},

Theatre provides an ideal opportunity to study rich face-to-face interactions in a controlled, yet natural setting. Here we collaborated with Flute Theatre to investigate interpersonal synchrony between actors-actors, actors-audience and audience-audience within a live theatrical setting. Our 28 participants consisted of 6 actors and 22 audience members, with 5 of these audience members being audience participants in the show. The performance was a compilation of acting, popular science talks and demonstrations, and an audience participation period. Interpersonal synchrony was measured using inertial measurement unit (IMU) wearable accelerometers worn on the heads of participants, whilst audio-visual data recorded everything that occurred on the stage. Participants also completed post-show self-report questionnaires on their engagement with the overall scientists and actors performance. Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT) and Wavelet Coherence Transform (WCT) analysis were conducted to extract synchrony at different frequencies, pairing with audio-visual data. Findings revealed that XWT and WCT analysis are useful methods in extracting the multiple types of synchronous activity that occurs when people perform or watch a live performance together. We also found that audience members with higher ratings on questionnaire items such as the strength of their emotional response to the performance, or how empowered they felt by the performance, showed a high degree of interpersonal synchrony with actors during the acting segments of performance. We further found that audience members rated the scientists performance higher than the actors performance on questions related to their emotional response to the performance as well as, how uplifted, empowered, and connected to social issues they felt. This shows the types of potent connections audience members can have with live performances. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of the performance context for audience engagement, in our case a theatre performance as part of public engagement with science rather than a stand-alone theatre performance. In sum we conclude that interdisciplinary real-world paradigms are an important and understudied route to understanding in-person social interactions.},

	abstract = {We explore an as yet unexploited opportunity for drastically improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) with global model parameters. Regular SGVB estimators rely on sampling of parameters once per minibatch of data, and have variance that is constant w.r.t. the minibatch size. The efficiency of such estimators can be drastically improved upon by translating uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such reparameterizations with local noise can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence.We find an important connection with regularization by dropout: the original Gaussian dropout objective corresponds to SGVB with local noise, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we propose {\textbackslash}emph\{variational dropout\}, a generalization of Gaussian dropout, but with a more flexibly parameterized posterior, often leading to better generalization. The method is demonstrated through several experiments.},

Also, the SA approach is adapted to handle discrete variables and to aggregate multiple sensitivity responses. Moreover, several visualizations for the SA results are introduced, such as input pair importance color matrix and variable effect characteristic surface. A wide range of experiments was performed in order to test the SA methods and measures by fitting four well-known models (NN, SVM, RF and decision trees) to synthetic datasets (five regression and five classification tasks).

To date, treatments are scarce, often involving pharmacological agents, but none have been shown to improve movement abnormalities effectively. Virtual reality (VR) is a tool used to simulate virtual environments where behavioral performance can be quantified safely across different tasks while exerting control over stimulus delivery, feedback and measurement in real time. Sensory information is transmitted via a head mounted display allowing users to directly interact with virtual objects and bodies using gestures and body movements in the real world to perform different actions, permitting a sense of immersion in the simulated virtual environment. Although, VR has been widely used for successful motor rehabilitation in a variety of different neurological domains, none have been exploited for motor rehabilitation in schizophrenia. The objectives of this article are to review movement abnormalities specific to schizophrenia, and how VR can be utilized to restore and improve motor functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Constructing VR-mediated motor-cognitive interventions that can help in retaining and transferring the learned outcomes to real life are also discussed.},

Our observations and discussions with participants demonstrate the utility of IML as a tool for participatory design of accessible interfaces. This work has also led to a better understanding of challenges in end-user training of learning models, of how people develop personalised interaction strategies with different types of pre-trained interfaces, and of how properties of control spaces and input devices influence people's customisation strategies and engagement with instruments. This work has also uncovered similarities between the musical goals and practices of disabled people and those of expert musicians.},

We introduce local feature importance as a local version of a recent model-agnostic global feature importance method. Based on local feature importance, we propose two visual tools: partial importance (PI) and individual conditional importance (ICI) plots which visualize how changes in a feature affect the model performance on average, as well as for individual observations. Our proposed methods are related to partial dependence (PD) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, but visualize the expected (conditional) feature importance instead of the expected (conditional) prediction. Furthermore, we show that averaging ICI curves across observations yields a PI curve, and integrating the PI curve with respect to the distribution of the considered feature results in the global feature importance. Another contribution of our paper is the Shapley feature importance, which fairly distributes the overall performance of a model among the features according to the marginal contributions and which can be used to compare the feature importance across different models.},

	abstract = {People might assume that dancing with a digital avatar would be a relatively distant, dehumanizing or disembodied process. However, in this article we propose that eﬀective and creative choreographic practice can be achieved by working with a virtual representation of a dancer, and we oﬀer two case studies to evidence the practical application of motion capture technology within this context. We observed that the virtual model quickly and naturally becomes an extension of the dancer’s interiority and that a dynamic aﬀective attunement between dancer and avatar spontaneously develops. We describe how the relationship between the physical and the virtual dancing body raises several practical, theoretical and even philosophical questions for choreographic approach, style and process. Building from Susanne Langer’s (1953) germinal conception of the ‘virtual powers’ of dance, we articulate a practice-led research opportunity to critically reﬂect on conventional choreographic practices through the aﬀordances of a speciﬁcally digital virtuality, in ways that can open out the kinds of aﬀective, emotional and phenomenological frameworks within which creation occurs. The unique aﬀordances of recent motion capture systems, oﬀer naturalistic threedimensional environments with an increased improvisational interactivity that simply cannot be achieved with video-based media.},

Du Bois's contributions to sociology and critical social theory: from Du Bois as inventor of sociology of race, to Du Bois as the first sociologist of American religion; from Du Bois as a pioneer of urban and rural sociology, to Du Bois as innovator of sociology of gender and culture; and, finally, from Du Bois as groundbreaking sociologist of education and critical criminologist, to Du Bois as dialectical critic of the disciplinary decadence of sociology and the American academy. What this volume offers that is wholly innovative and distinctive is that it brings together the watershed work of classical and contemporary, male and female, black and white, national and international sociologists and social theorists with the express intent of creating critical inventories and thoroughly interrogating what has been included, and what has been excluded, when we come to W.E.B. Du Bois's contributions to the discipline of sociology. Unlike any other anthologies on Du Bois, this volume offers an excellent overview of the critical commentary on arguably one of the most imaginative and innovative, perceptive and prolific founders of the discipline of sociology. It will therefore be of interest to scholars and students not just in sociology, but also Africana studies, American studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, gender studies and postcolonial studies, as well as "traditional" disciplines, such as, history, philosophy, political science, economics, education, and religion.},

	abstract = {In machine learning, a variational autoencoder (VAE), is an artificial neural network architecture introduced by Diederik P. Kingma and Max Welling, belonging to the families of probabilistic graphical models and variational Bayesian methods.Variational autoencoders are often associated with the autoencoder model because of its architectural affinity, but with significant differences in the goal and mathematical formulation. Variational autoencoders are probabilistic generative models that require neural networks as only a part of their overall structure. The neural network components are typically referred to as the encoder and decoder for the first and second component respectively. The first neural network maps the input variable to a latent space that corresponds to the parameters of a variational distribution. In this way, the encoder can produce multiple different samples that all come from the same distribution. The decoder has the opposite function, which is to map from the latent space to the input space, in order to produce or generate data points. Both networks are typically trained together with the usage of the reparameterization trick, although the variance of the noise model can be learned separately.
Although this type of model was initially designed for unsupervised learning, its effectiveness has been proven for semi-supervised learning and supervised learning.},

We show how these primitives can be combined into a set of interaction patterns which can capture common interactions between humans and AI/ML models. The motivation behind this is twofold: firstly, to provide a compact generalization of existing practices for the design and implementation of HAI interactions; and secondly, to support the creation of new interactions by extending the design space of HAI interactions. Taking into consideration frameworks, guidelines, and taxonomies related to human-centered design and implementation of AI systems, we define a vocabulary for describing information exchanges based on the model’s characteristics and interactional capabilities. Based on this vocabulary, a message passing model for interactions between humans and models is presented, which we demonstrate can account for existing HAI interaction systems and approaches. Finally, we build this into design patterns which can describe common interactions between users and models, and we discuss how this approach can be used toward a design space for HAI interactions that creates new possibilities for designs as well as keeping track of implementation issues and concerns.},

In my research, I aim to better understand code performances and how we can support them. In a recent project, I explored how a version control system could benefit live coding music. I found that backtracking affordances could facilitate incorporating musical form on the fly and that version trees could act as a visual aid for both the performer and the audience. In another ongoing project, I am exploring how to support live coding in the CS classroom, focusing on increasing audience learning and engagement.

To understand the hermeneutics of these relationships, we develop key concepts from Material Engagement Theory (MET) and Postphenomenology (PP). To push these frameworks into the realm of digital design, we develop the concept of Digital Materiality. Digital Materiality describes the way successive layers of mathematics, code, and software come to mediate enactive perception, and the possibilities of creative material engagement actualised in work with software. Just as molecular materials come to transform action with material objects, so digital materiality comes to enable and transform creative practices with computers. Digital architectural design form a new space for ongoing enactive discovery and creativity through manipulation of digital models and their underlying software environments. By shifting relationships within their digital models, architects can direct their attention, intention, and imagination towards widely different aspects of the model. Here, creative imagination becomes a fundamentally situated activity where mind emerges through dynamic interaction between a variety of embodied, material, and cultural domains.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the cultural ramifications of music generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Deploying complex algorithms to create original music productions, AI’s automation of human authorship may suggest a radically new sonic form. However, its creators have preferred to use its tools to mimic established musical genres from the past. As a result, notable AI-music programmers like composer David Cope and software developers Flow Machines have galvanized the public’s interest in AI-generated music not by creating completely alien sonic forms, but by simulating popular styles like rock and classical music. Consequently, listeners often report AI music sounds unnervingly familiar rather than aesthetically inaccessible. I argue that it is precisely AI music’s devotion to uncannily approximating its human forebears that makes it such an interesting object of contemporary sonic production. It also provides a useful historical parallel to a short-lived musical movement from the 2000s known as sonic hauntology. Much like AI programmers, producers of sonic hauntology applied digital technology to the sonic past. However, they confronted it in more deliberately political and subversive ways. Sampling sonic artifacts and cultural marginalia from the mid-20th century, sonic hauntologists created eerie soundscapes designed to challenge mass culture’s erasure of history’s political depth, or what Fredric Jameson famously referred to as late capitalism’s cultural logic of postmodernism. While AI music has yet to be exploited in this way, I argue its inherently “uneasy listening” carries the potential to further sonic hauntology’s project of repurposing the sonic past to estrange listeners from the present moment.},

To gain a better understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes that occur during such interactions, we carried out an exploratory study where we collected self-report and continuous behavioural and physiological measures from pairs of improvising drummers. Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom. Our results indicate that ECG, motion, and glance measurements could be particularly suitable for the investigation of collaborative music making.},

In particular it looks at interactive algorithmic musical practices and the takes a distributed view of the influences involved in such music making. The elements involved include humans, tools, culture and the physical environment that constitute a system or network of mutual influences. Such an agency network perspective is intended to be useful for the pragmatic tasks of designing new interactive music systems and developing new musical practices that utilise them. Drawing on previous research into generative music and computational creativity, various views on interactive music systems are canvassed and an approach to describing these as agency networks is developed. It is suggested that new human-machine musical practices may arise as a result of adopting an agency network perspective and that these, in turn, can drive cultural innovations.},

In this paper we propose an effective Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy, based on a feature clustering method that captures the different semantic modes of the feature distribution and groups features of the same class into tight and well-separated clusters. Furthermore, we introduce two novel learning objectives to enhance the discriminative clustering performance: an orthogonality loss forces spaced out individual representations to be orthogonal, while a sparsity loss reduces class-wise the number of active feature channels. The joint effect of these modules is to regularize the structure of the feature space. Extensive evaluations in the synthetic-to-real scenario show that we achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

This article brings together many different perspectives on understanding human movement knowledge and movement interaction. This understanding shows that the embodied knowledge involved in movement interaction is very different from the representational knowledge involved in a traditional interface, so a very different approach to design is needed.

	abstract = {A remarkable time of human promise has been ushered in by the convergence of the ever-expanding availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch of cloud computing platforms, and the advancement of increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Innovations in AI are already leaving a mark on government by improving the provision of essential social goods and services from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and environmental management. These bounties are likely just the start. The prospect that progress in AI will help government to confront some of its most urgent challenges is exciting, but legitimate worries abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving technology, a steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made and that both unanticipated and harmful impacts will occur. This guide, written for department and delivery leads in the UK public sector and adopted by the British Government in its publication, 'Using AI in the Public Sector,' identifies the potential harms caused by AI systems and proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract them. It stresses that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent these potential harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by putting in place governance processes that support the design and implementation of ethical, fair, and safe AI systems. It also highlights the need for algorithmically supported outcomes to be interpretable by their users and made understandable to decision subjects in clear, non-technical, and accessible ways. Finally, it builds out a vision of human-centred and context-sensitive implementation that gives a central role to communication, evidence-based reasoning, situational awareness, and moral justifiability.},

In this work, we consider how a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of simple music gestures may be integrated into a physical instrument so that predictions are sonically and physically entwined with the performer's actions. We introduce EMPI, an embodied musical prediction interface that simplifies musical interaction and prediction to just one dimension of continuous input and output. The predictive model is a mixture density RNN trained to estimate the performer's next physical input action and the time at which this will occur. Predictions are represented sonically through synthesized audio, and physically with a motorized output indicator. We use EMPI to investigate how performers understand and exploit different predictive models to make music through a controlled study of performances with different models and levels of physical feedback. We show that while performers often favor a model trained on human-sourced data, they find different musical affordances in models trained on synthetic, and even random, data. Physical representation of predictions seemed to affect the length of performances. This work contributes new understandings of how musicians use generative ML models in real-time performance backed up by experimental evidence. We argue that a constrained musical interface can expose the affordances of embodied predictive interactions.},

In this article, the authors use a Leopoldian framework as a heuristic device to interpret the environmental history of the land in one small place—the Keweenaw Peninsula of northern Michigan—where successive human purposes altered the landscape dramatically over time. This article identifies the historical roles that power relations and the land ethic have played in land use and land health. The article concludes by identifying the need for community action based in a land ethic to maintain a healthy forest through sustainable use. Although it is unlikely the Keweenaw forest will return to its preindustrial state, the community can aim for a forest that exemplifies Leopold's qualities of integrity, stability, productivity, and beauty.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in general-purpose AI have highlighted the importance of guiding AI systems towards the intended goals, ethical principles, and values of individuals and groups, a concept broadly recognized as alignment. However, the lack of clarified definitions and scopes of human-AI alignment poses a significant obstacle, hampering collaborative efforts across research domains to achieve this alignment. In particular, ML- and philosophy-oriented alignment research often views AI alignment as a static, unidirectional process (i.e., aiming to ensure that AI systems' objectives match humans) rather than an ongoing, mutual alignment problem. This perspective largely neglects the long-term interaction and dynamic changes of alignment. To understand these gaps, we introduce a systematic review of over 400 papers published between 2019 and January 2024, spanning multiple domains such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML). We characterize, define and scope human-AI alignment. From this, we present a conceptual framework of "Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment" to organize the literature from a human-centered perspective. This framework encompasses both 1) conventional studies of aligning AI to humans that ensures AI produces the intended outcomes determined by humans, and 2) a proposed concept of aligning humans to AI, which aims to help individuals and society adjust to AI advancements both cognitively and behaviorally. Additionally, we articulate the key findings derived from literature analysis, including literature gaps and trends, human values, and interaction techniques. To pave the way for future studies, we envision three key challenges and give recommendations for future research.},

In this paper, we conducted a diffractive analysis exploring the potential role of prompt-based interfaces in artists’ creative practice. Over a two week period, seven visual artists were given access to a personalised instance of Stable Diffusion, fine-tuned on a dataset of their work. In the following diffractive analysis, we identified two dominant modes adopted by participants, AI for ideation, and AI for production. We furthermore present a number of ethical design considerations for the future development of generative AI interfaces.},

By focusing on the differences in how we experienced the heritage sites, we analyse the duality of discomfort, a common concept in HCI, in that it can both be deployed as a resource for designing systems that can transform people’s understanding of history or it can be a hindrance for engagement, having an unequal effect on individuals.},

In this paper, we qualitatively analyze reflective interviews of past participants of collaborations from multiple perspectives: visualization graduate students, visualization professors, and domain collaborators. We juxtapose the perspectives of these individuals, revealing tensions about the tools that are built and the relationships that are formed — a complex web of competing motivations. Through the lens of matters of care, we interpret this web, concluding with considerations that both trouble and necessitate reformation of current patterns around collaborative work in visualization design studies to promote more equitable, useful, and care-ful outcomes.},

The image appears within the book as well, midway through the seminal 1984 essay “Eclipse of the Spectacle.” Though not commented upon in the text, Media Burn is emblematic of many of the themes running through this rich collection of spectacle, mass media, and modern technology. Specifically, television and the automobile (and their intersection) feature frequently in these pages. Highlighting the motion blur of the speeding car, the photograph illustrates velocity even as the stack of televisions conveys a sense of technological obsolescence. Perhaps above all, the vision of shattering, literally and metaphorically, the facade of electronic screens reflects the overriding concern of these writings.},

We develop RiCE through i) an expert review of questionnaire items (n=10) and ii) an exploratory factor analysis (n=300) of the reviewed items. We also present a user study testing RiCE (n=58) across two time points (one week apart) with novel interfaces designed for creative writing and music making. Although we do not confirm validity, we identify four factors for RiCE which we suggest are interpretable in a conceptually meaningful way.

	abstract = {Technological advances have always played a central role in shaping the production of popular music. Over the past few years, music generation systems started to attract considerable interest within the academic community, although the proposed prototypes rarely managed to emerge and be adopted by producers in their professional workflows. We argue that a major cause of that is the inherent complexity of integrating those systems into well-established music production pipelines, especially given that most of them are designed with the intent of replacing human creativity rather than assisting it. To this end, we discuss our proposal for a novel approach for Intelligent Music Production based on samples arrangement. Such a tools could offer several potential benefits in enhancing human creativity, as they provide the opportunity to keep human artists in the creative loop as well as to reduce computational costs and hardware requirements, making music production more accessible. As a first step towards this direction, we eventually present MusiComb, a prototype for sample-based music generation. Alongside, we report how this relatively simple system has demonstrated its ability to produce realistic tracks in few seconds while adhering to user-defined constraints.},

	abstract = {In discourse on the topic, the question of what constitutes a musical ‘borrowing’, if raised at all, is usually restricted in scope and framed as one of terminology – that is, of determining the right term to characterise a particular borrowing act. In this way has arisen a welter of terms that, however expressive of nuance, have precluded evaluation of the phenomenon as such. This is in part a consequence of general disregard for the fact that to conceive of musical borrowing entails correlative concepts, all of which precondition it, yet none self-evidently. Further preclusive of clarity, the musico-analytic lens of borrowing is typically invoked only in counterpoint to a quintessentially Western aesthetic category of composition ex nihilo. As a consequence, the fundamental role played by borrowing in musical domains situated at the periphery of the Western art music tradition, specifically pre-modern polyphony and twentieth-century musique concrète, has been overlooked. This article seeks to bridge such lacunae in our understanding of musical borrowing via phenomenological investigation into its conceptual and historical foundations. A more comprehensive evaluation of musical borrowing, one capable of accounting for its diverse instantiations while simultaneously disclosing what makes all of them ‘borrowings’ in the first place, is thereby attainable.},

It centres on a discussion of the nature of sound’s ontological status and aims to contribute to a new understanding of the role of materiality in artistic practices. A central point of discussion is Pierre Schaeffer’s notion of the sound object, which is critically examined. The phenomenological perspective that underlies the concept of the sound object depicts sound as an ideal unity constituted by a subject’s intentionality. Thus, it can barely grasp the physicality of sounds and their production or their reality beyond individual perception. This article aims to challenge the notion of the sound object as a purely perceptual phenomenon while trying to rethink experimentation as a practical form of thought that takes place through interacting with sonorous material. Against the background of recent object-oriented and materialist philosophical theories and by drawing on the Heideggerian concept of the thing and Gilbert Simondon’s theories of perception and individuation, this article strives to outline a conception of sound as a non-symbolic otherness. The proposed idea of thingness revolves around a morphogenetic conception of the becoming of sonorous forms that links their perception to their physicality.},

Self-explaining models where interpretability plays a key role already during learning have received much less attention. We propose three desiderata for explanations in general -- explicitness, faithfulness, and stability -- and show that existing methods do not satisfy them. In response, we design self-explaining models in stages, progressively generalizing linear classifiers to complex yet architecturally explicit models. Faithfulness and stability are enforced via regularization specifically tailored to such models.

	abstract = {We are largely used to hearing explanations. For example, if someone thinks you are sad today, they might reply to your “why?” with “because you were so Hmmmmm-mmm-mmm”. Today’s Artificial Intelligence (AI), however, is – if at all – largely providing explanations of decisions in a visual or textual manner. While such approaches are good for communication via visual media such as in research papers or screens of intelligent devices, they may not always be the best way to explain; especially when the end user is not an expert. In particular, when the AI’s task is about Audio Intelligence, visual explanations appear less intuitive than audible, sonified ones. Sonification has also great potential for explainable AI (XAI) in systems that deal with non-audio data – for example, because it does not require visual contact or active attention of a user. Hence, sonified explanations of AI decisions face a challenging, yet highly promising and pioneering task. That involves incorporating innovative XAI algorithms to allow pointing back at the learning data responsible for decisions made by an AI, and to include decomposition of the data to identify salient aspects. It further aims to identify the components of the preprocessing, feature representation, and learnt attention patterns that are responsible for the decisions. Finally, it targets decision-making at the model-level, to provide a holistic explanation of the chain of processing in typical pattern recognition problems from end-to-end. Sonified AI explanations will need to unite methods for sonification of the identified aspects that benefit decisions, decomposition and recomposition of audio to sonify which parts in the audio were responsible for the decision, and rendering attention patterns and salient feature representations audible. Benchmarking sonified XAI is challenging, as it will require a comparison against a backdrop of existing, state-of-the-art visual and textual alternatives, as well as synergistic complementation of all modalities in user evaluations. Sonified AI explanations will need to target different user groups to allow personalisation of the sonification experience for different user needs, to lead to a major breakthrough in comprehensibility of AI via hearing how decisions are made, hence supporting tomorrow’s humane AI’s trustability. Here, we introduce and motivate the general idea, and provide accompanying considerations including milestones of realisation of sonifed XAI and foreseeable risks.},

The paper examines the emergence of LANDR, an online platform that oﬀers automated music mastering, built on top of supervised machine learning branded as artiﬁcial intelligence. Increasingly, machine learning will become an integral part of signal processing for sounds and images, shaping the way media cultures sound, look, and feel. While LANDR is a product of the so-called ‘big bang’ in machine learning, it could not exist without speciﬁc conditions: speciﬁc kinds of commensurable data, as well as speciﬁc aesthetic and industrial conditions. Mastering, in turn, has become an indispensable but understudied part of music circulation as an infrastructural practice. Here we analyze the intersecting histories of machine learning and mastering, as well as LANDR’s failure at automating other domains of audio engineering. By doing so, we critique the discourse of AI’s inevitability and show the ways in which machine learning must frame or reframe cultural and aesthetic practices in order to automate them, in service of digital distribution, recognition, and recommendation infrastructures.},

More specifically, we derive explicit closed form expressions for the explanations output by these two methods and show that they both converge to the same explanation in expectation, i.e., when the number of perturbed samples used by these methods is large. We then leverage this connection to establish other desirable properties, such as robustness, for these techniques. We also derive finite sample complexity bounds for the number of perturbations required for these methods to converge to their expected explanation. Finally, we empirically validate our theory using extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real world datasets.},

Using topic modeling, co-occurrence and network analysis, we mapped the research space from diverse domains, such as algorith-mic accountability, interpretable machine learning, context-awareness, cognitive psychology, and software learnability. We reveal fading and burgeoning trends in explainable systems, and identify domains that are closely connected or mostly isolated. The time is ripe for the HCI community to ensure that the powerful new autonomous systems have intelligible interfaces built-in.

To alleviate this issue, researchers often employ "transfer learning" that transfers knowledge from a source data distribution to a target data distribution, instead of training the whole model from scratch. Typically, the last few layers of a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) are chosen for many transfer learning tasks where the outputs of those selected layers are combined to construct a feature space based on which a task-specific classification n etwork i s t rained o r fi ne-tuned. Th is arbitrary way of selecting layers, however, often fails to achieve the desired accuracy for the target task. What we need is an intelligent way of selecting layers from a pretrained model for a given task so that the additional overhead of successive training remains low. To this end, we propose a novel method, called TransJury, to find t he m ost s ignificant la yers from a pretrained mo del for transfer learning along with preserving the knowledge for the source domain. Through extensive experimentation on several target domain datasets, we show the supremacy of our approach in terms of lower training overhead and improved accuracy.

In this paper we introduce a strategy for the analysis of the sonic response of synthesizers subject to the variation of an arbitrary set of parameters. We use an extensive set of sound descriptors which are ranked using a novel metric based on statistical analysis. This enables the study of how changes to a synthesis parameter affect timbral descriptors, and provides a multidimensional model for the mapping of the synthesis control through specific timbre spaces. The analysis, modeling and mapping are integrated in the Timbre Space Analyzer \& Mapper (TSAM) tool, which enables further investigation into synthesis sonic response and on perceptually related sonic interactions.},

The realistic tonal beaviour of modelled strings compared to adjacent strings of a real instrument, and multiple-stopping performance techniques (e.g. when a 4-pitch chord is played using “quadruplestop”). This enables the interaction of the string with the left-hand fingering. The artistic performance using physical modelling synthesis is shown to be feasible by using only two string models.

	abstract = {"A fascinating look at Artificial Intelligence, from its humble Cold War beginnings to the dazzling future that is just around the corner. When most of us think about Artificial Intelligence, our minds go straight to cyborgs, robots, and sci-fi thrillers where machines take over the world. But the truth is that Artificial Intelligence is already among us. It exists in our smartphones, fitness trackers, and refrigerators that tell us when the milk will expire. In some ways, the future people dreamed of at the World's Fair in the 1960s is already here. We're teaching our machines how to think like humans, and they're learning at an incredible rate. In Thinking Machines, technology journalist Luke Dormehl takes you through the history of AI and how it makes up the foundations of the machines that think for us today. Furthermore, Dormehl speculates on the incredible--and possibly terrifying--future that's much closer than many would imagine. This remarkable book will invite you to marvel at what now seems commonplace and to dream about a future in which the scope of humanity may need to widen to include intelligent machines"--},

	abstract = {Despite a growing interest in posthuman research methodologies within educational research, there has been limited research to date which applies this theory to music education. We consider that there is much that posthumanism and music education may offer each other, particularly within the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic which challenges us to innovate rapidly within our educational and research practices. We explore the potential of this methodology through conducting a ‘diffractive analysis,’ an approach to enquiry associated with posthuman theory. Drawing on data collected during a participatory music project involving children with SEND [Special Educational Needs and Disabilities], professional musicians, trainee generalist primary teachers and ourselves as facilitators and researchers, we draw out the potential of a diffractive analysis by putting it into dialogue with a thematic analysis of the same data. In documenting this we describe our own process of co-becoming as researchers, entangled with our research and our data. We describe the research processes that we followed, and through a comparison of materials produced during our initial analysis, we consider the similarities, differences and conversations that emerge.},

We report on a series of nine workshops with 48 children. Based on a thematic analysis, we present four themes — Technology as Utility and Authority, Individual and Collective Place-Making, Staged and Emerging Conflicts, Belonging to the Group and Self-Expression — which we use to inform three design directions for developing DivComp Spaces specifically in the context of school. Finally, we critically reflect on our design practice and the difficulties of designing not only for, but also with diversity meaningfully embedded into design processes.},

These involve a commitment to view human experience in encounters with technology as relational and contingent, and research apparatuses as co-producers rather than passive observers of phenomena. In this paper, we argue that sound is the sensory modality best suited to the investigation of entanglements. Materialist theories of sound and listening guide both the design of a novel interactive sound installation and the methodological approach of a participant study exploring the experience of listening. We present a diffractive analysis whereby micro-phenomenological interview data is read with sonic theories, generating accounts that might otherwise remain mute: the temporal fluctuation and physical feeling of proximity in listener entanglements with sound, somatic intention setting, and plural interpretations of interactivity. Finally, we offer a series of provocations for HCI to embrace qualities of the sonic and consider epistemological positions grounded in other sense modalities.},

From this discussion we propose a design strategy meant to capture the relevant time-frequency contexts for learning timbre, which permits using domain knowledge for designing architectures. In addition, one of our main goals is to design efficient CNN architectures -- what reduces the risk of these models to over-fit, since CNNs' number of parameters is minimized. Several architectures based on the design principles we propose are successfully assessed for different research tasks related to timbre: singing voice phoneme classification, musical instrument recognition and music auto-tagging.},

This paper reviews the extensive literature about this system, adding new statistical analyses of behavioral data where they have been missing, demonstrating that turn-taking has the systematic properties originally noted by Sacks et al. (1974; hereafter SSJ). This system poses some significant puzzles for current theories of language processing: the gaps between turns are short (of the order of 200 ms), but the latencies involved in language production are much longer (over 600 ms). This seems to imply that participants in conversation must predict (or ‘project’ as SSJ have it) the end of the current speaker’s turn in order to prepare their response in advance. This in turn implies some overlap between production and comprehension despite their use of common processing resources. Collecting together what is known behaviorally and experimentally about the system, the space for systematic explanations of language processing for conversation can be significantly narrowed, and we sketch some first model of the mental processes involved for the participant preparing to speak next.},

	abstract = {We propose a time-domain audio source separation method using down-sampling (DS) and up-sampling (US) layers based on a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The proposed method is based on one of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks, Wave-U-Net, which successively down-samples and up-samples feature maps. We find that this architecture resembles that of multiresolution analysis, and reveal that the DS layers of Wave-U-Net cause aliasing and may discard information useful for the separation. Although the effects of these problems may be reduced by training, to achieve a more reliable source separation method, we should design DS layers capable of overcoming the problems. With this belief, focusing on the fact that the DWT has an anti-aliasing filter and the perfect reconstruction property, we design the proposed layers. Experiments on music source separation show the efficacy of the proposed method and the importance of simultaneously considering the anti-aliasing filters and the perfect reconstruction property.},

	abstract = {The function of timbre in 20th Century instrumental music is discussed in terms of the relation between timbre and musical language. Up to the 19th Century, the function of timbre was primarily related to its identity in addition to being charged with certain effective and symbolic characteristics. The identities of Western instruments are standardized, investing them with a certain neutrality that allows the construction of pitch hierarchies that are unperturbed by differences in timbre of the instruments. For small ensembles, timbre has a stability and a separating power that provides an identification and clarification of form and timbre. The function of timbral identity is one of articulation. With the modern orchestra, the use of instruments is more flexible and their identification becomes more mobile and temporary. Composing the blending of timbres into complex sound‐objects follows from the confronting of established sound hierarchies and an enriching of the sound vocabulary. The function of timbre in composed sound‐objects is one of illusion and is based upon the technique of fusion. One contrasts, then, notions of raw timbre and organized timbre. The importance of discontinuity in musical dimensions for composition is considered with respect to timbre. Finally, the relation between timbre, composition and sound transmission in an acoustic space is discussed.},

However, most of these electronic assistive devices are typically too difficult for daily use and challenging to modify to accommodate variations in body shape and medical needs. For existing clinicians, the customization pipeline of these smart devices imposes significant learning costs. This paper introduces ThermoFit, an end-to-end design and fabrication pipeline for thermoforming smart orthoses that adheres to the clinically accepted procedure. ThermoFit enables the shapes and electronics positions of smart orthoses to conform to bodies and allows rapid iteration by integrating low-cost Low-Temperature Thermoplastics (LTTPs) with custom metamaterial structures and electronic components. Specifically, three types of metamaterial structures are used in LTTPs to reduce the wrinkles caused by the thermoforming process and to permit component position adjustment and joint movement. A design tool prototype aids in generating metamaterial patterns and optimizing component placement and circuit routing. Three applications show that ThermoFit can be shaped on bodies to different wearables. Finally, a hands-on study with a clinician verifies the user-friendliness of thermoforming smart orthosis, and technical evaluations demonstrate fabrication efficiency and electronic continuity.},

We investigated this discrepancy through the prism of the emotional user-smartphone relationship by having people write love/breakup letters to their smartphones. We gathered 82 letters – 42 before and 40 during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a mixed nature regarding the distribution of love and breakup letters and associated emotions based on the revisited OCC-model of emotions – with a slight shift towards the negative emotional spectrum during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we performed an extensive qualitative analysis of 819 user statements extracted from the letters, resulting in a connection of emotions to 17 smartphone features and eight themes of real-life consequences of smartphone use. We then identified eight common patterns of this connection, classified as smartphone roles. The collected letters mostly model a complex user-smartphone relationship, comprising different roles depending on users’ inner and outer context. We discuss how HCI could help in shaping the complex user-smartphone relationship in future research and suggest supporting a healthy balance between users’ daily life and smartphone use.

Its evolution in the 1960s and 1970s evidencing improved working practices and joint agreements between workers and management are contrasted with the much harsher economic climate of the 1980s and 1990s when such principled practices, with one or two notable exceptions, gave way to lean production, downsizing and cost cutting in a global economy, partly reﬂecting the impact of information and communications technology. Different future scenarios are discussed where socio-technical principles might return in a different guise to humanize the potential impact of technology in a world of work where consistent organizational and economic change are the norm.},

First, we characterize the concept "disentangled representations" used in supervised and unsupervised methods along three dimensions-informativeness, separability and interpretability - which can be expressed and quantified explicitly using information-theoretic constructs. This helps explain the behaviors of several well-known disentanglement learning models. We then propose robust metrics for measuring informativeness, separability and interpretability. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments, we show that our metrics correctly characterize the representations learned by different methods and are consistent with qualitative (visual) results. Thus, the metrics allow disentanglement learning methods to be compared on a fair ground. We also empirically uncovered new interesting properties of VAE-based methods and interpreted them with our formulation. These findings are promising and hopefully will encourage the design of more theoretically driven models for learning disentangled representations.},

            In the domain of music for performers and electronic sounds (whether fixed or live) there are various paradigms of interaction: the performer(s) may be situated in an electroacoustic ‘environment’; there may be a primarily responsorial or ‘proliferating’ relationship; or the relationship may be closer to the traditional one between soloist and accompaniment. These paradigms preserve a relatively unproblematic dichotomy between performer, whose sound is inextricably linked to a sense of action, presence and spontaneity, and fixed or treated sound, which is more or less de-coupled from this presence. Once one tries to create a continuous, intimate relation between the two, so that one is dealing with an extension of the instrument rather than an emulated ‘other’ or environmental context, one is confronted with a fundamental difference between a sounding body whose physical properties transparently determine its sonic possibilities, and the loudspeaker, which can produce practically any sound at all. This paper interrogates this dichotomy between the fallible-corporeal and the fixed-disembodied, activating questions both about the social fact of live performance and about the compositional practices which give rise to a sense of extended instrumentality.},

	abstract = {This article specifically addresses electroacoustic music compositions that borrow from existing musical and sound resources. Investigating works that borrow and thrive upon existing sound sources presents an array of issues regarding terminology, authorship and creativity. Embedding borrowed elements into new electroacoustic music goes beyond the simplicity of ‘cut and paste’ as composers approach this practice with new and novel techniques. Musical borrowings have been widely studied in fields of popular and classical music, from cover songs to quotations and from pastiches to theme and variations; however, borrowings that take place within the field of electroacoustic music can be less clear or defined, and demand a closer look. Because the components and building blocks of electroacoustic music are often recorded sound, the categories of borrowing become vast; thus incidences of borrowing, in some shape or form, can appear inevitable or unavoidable when composing. The author takes on this issue and proposes a new framework for categorising borrowings as a helpful aid for others looking to sample in new compositional work, as well as for further musicological study. The article will consider the compositional process of integration and reworking of borrowed material, using a repertoire study to showcase the variety of techniques in play when sound materials change hands, composer to composer. Terminology already in use by others to describe sound borrowing in electroacoustic music will be investigated in an effort to show the multitude of considerations and components in action when borrowing takes place. Motivations for borrowing, borrowing types, borrowing durations, copying as imitation, and composers’ reflections upon borrowing will all be considered within the article, along with discussions on programmatic development and embedding techniques. At the heart of this article, the author aims to show how widespread and pervasive borrowing is within the electroacoustic repertoire by drawing attention to varieties of sound transplants, all considered as acts of borrowing.},

	abstract = {Title. The use of conversational analysis: nurse–patient interaction in communication disability after stroke. Aim. This paper is a report of a study to explore how nursing staff and patients with aphasia or dysarthria communicate with each other in natural interactions on a specialist stroke ward. Background. Nursing staff often talk with patients in a functional manner, using minimal social or affective communication. Little nursing research has been carried out with patients who have communication difficulties. Conversational analysis, used in other healthcare settings, is a way to explore these interactions in depth in order to gain further understanding of the communication process. Method. An observational study was carried out in 2005 and the data were 35·5 hours of videotape recording and field notes with 14 nursing staff and five patients with aphasia or dysarthria. The recordings were analysed using conversation analysis. Findings. Nursing staff controlled the conversations by controlling the topic and flow of conversations, creating asymmetry in all interactions. Patients had very little input because of taking short turns and responding to closed questions. These behaviours are related to the institutional context in which they occur. Conclusion. In rehabilitation, the focus for interaction may be thought to be patient goals, worries or plans for the future, but in this study nursing staff controlled the conversations around nursing tasks. This may be because they do not have the confidence to hold conversations with people with communication problems. Nursing staff need to receive training to reinforce communication rehabilitation programmes and to engage more fully with patients in their care, but also that a wider institutional culture of partnership is developed on stroke wards.},

            In the domain of music for performers and electronic sounds (whether fixed or live) there are various paradigms of interaction: the performer(s) may be situated in an electroacoustic ‘environment’; there may be a primarily responsorial or ‘proliferating’ relationship; or the relationship may be closer to the traditional one between soloist and accompaniment. These paradigms preserve a relatively unproblematic dichotomy between performer, whose sound is inextricably linked to a sense of action, presence and spontaneity, and fixed or treated sound, which is more or less de-coupled from this presence. Once one tries to create a continuous, intimate relation between the two, so that one is dealing with an extension of the instrument rather than an emulated ‘other’ or environmental context, one is confronted with a fundamental difference between a sounding body whose physical properties transparently determine its sonic possibilities, and the loudspeaker, which can produce practically any sound at all.

Illustrated with almost 200 photos, and accompanied by comprehensive discographies, this book is a vivid review of the hip hop world through the eyes and ears of more than 50 of the finest music writers and cultural critics at work today, including Danyel Smith, Greg Tate, Anthony deCurtis, dream hampton, Neil Strauss, and Bönz Malone."A history? No. A story, really. A tale from the dark side. In this book, hip hop is all. It's always there. Like hip hop, this book is about the intense kind of aspiration that comes from having little. About holding and rhyming into a microphone. Mixing and scratching. Guns pain blood. Desire desperation truth true love. Art and mystery and metaphor. The singularity of voice. The magnificence of ingenious sampling. The glory of a beat. This book is that story."-- From the Preface by Danyel Smith, editor-in-chief of VIBE, the voice of the hip hop generation, presents the essence of hip hop.},

The book distinguishes what belongs to artistic theory from what has traditionally been confused with it, namely aesthetic theory and offers as well a systematic account of metaphor, expression, and style, together with an original account of artistic representation.

Where data are often seen from a reductionist perspective –as neutral numbers and graphs– theory suggests that data are messy, subjective, and pertaining to more than the human alone. They are experienced and lived with, something which is often not accounted for in personal data. To explore what people themselves consider data, sixteen interlocutors participated in a cultural probe study where they visually documented what they considered data in their everyday lives. Our analysis indicates that data can be disciplinary, social, and extend beyond ourselves, incorporating more-than-human aspects. Data are often regarded for entertainment, work, and wellbeing purposes. As interlocutors actively engaged and lived with data, we end the pictorial with a working definition of personal data, which acknowledges people’s active roles in their data creation.},

	abstract = {Because humans lack a sensory vocabulary for auditory experiences, timbral qualities of sounds are often conceptualized and communicated through readily available sensory attributes from different modalities (e.g., bright, warm, sweet) but also through the use of onomatopoeic attributes (e.g., ringing, buzzing, shrill) or nonsensory attributes relating to abstract constructs (e.g., rich, complex, harsh). The analysis of the linguistic description of timbre, or timbre semantics, can be considered as one way to study its perceptual representation empirically. In the most commonly adopted approach, timbre is considered as a set of verbally defined perceptual attributes that represent the dimensions of a semantic timbre space. Previous studies have identified three salient semantic dimensions for timbre along with related acoustic properties. Comparisons with similarity-based multidimensional models confirm the strong link between perceiving timbre and talking about it. Still, the cognitive and neural mechanisms of timbre semantics remain largely unknown and underexplored, especially when one looks beyond the case of acoustic musical instruments.},

	abstract = {Eye gaze plays an important role in communication but understanding of its actual function or functions and the methods used to elucidate this have varied considerably. This systematized review was undertaken to summarize both the proposed functions of eye gaze in conversations of healthy adults and the methodological approaches employed. The eligibility criteria were restricted to a healthy adult population and excluded studies that manipulated eye gaze behavior. A total of 29 articles—quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods were returned, with a wide range of methodological designs. The main areas of variability related to number of conversants, their familiarity and status, conversation topic, data collection tools—video and eye tracking—and definitions of eye gaze. The findings confirm that eye gaze facilitates turn yielding, plays a role in speech monitoring, prevents and repairs conversation breakdowns and facilitates intentional and unintentional speech interruptions. These findings were remarkably consistent given the variability in methods across the 29 articles. However, in relation to turn initiation, the results were less consistent, requiring further investigation. This review provides a starting point for future studies to make informed decisions about study methods for examining eye gaze and selecting variables of interest.},

Drawing on fields ranging from philosophy and sound studies to black feminist studies and musicology, James shows how what she calls the sonic episteme-a set of sound-based rules that qualitatively structure social practices in much the same way that neoliberalism uses statistics-employs a politics of exception to maintain hegemonic neoliberal and biopolitical projects. Where James sees the normcore averageness of Taylor Swift and Spandau Ballet as contributing to the sonic episteme's marginalization of nonnormative conceptions of gender, race, and personhood, the black feminist political ontologies she identifies in Beyonce's and Rihanna's music challenge such marginalization. In using sound to theorize political ontology, subjectivity, and power, James argues for the further articulation of sonic practices that avoid contributing to the systemic relations of domination that biopolitical neoliberalism creates and polices.},

This can make organizational processes and procedures more pro-environmental, but does it also promote employees’ pro-environmental behaviour? We reason that CER can encourage employees to act pro-environmentally at work by increasing the likelihood that they consider the environmental consequences of their behaviour. In two studies, we test to what extent CER affects pro-environmental behaviour at work, and whether this depends on the extent to which employees value nature and the environment (i.e., endorse biospheric values). Both studies show that stronger biospheric values and perceived CER are related to more self-reported pro-environmental behaviour at work. Interestingly, the relationship between perceived CER and self-reported pro-environmental behaviour was stronger among those with moderate to weak biospheric values. These results suggest that relative weak biospheric values are less likely to inhibit pro-environmental behaviour at work when employees believe that their organization aims to realize CER.},

In addition, the debate on the legitimacy of such an appeal is presented as connected to the discussion on the nature of the aims and results of philosophical inquiries. Finally, the main tenets and results of experimental philosophers are discussed, highlighting the methodological limits of such studies.

Drawing on fields ranging from philosophy and sound studies to black feminist studies and musicology, James shows how what she calls the sonic episteme—a set of sound-based rules that qualitatively structure social practices in much the same way that neoliberalism uses statistics—employs a politics of exception to maintain hegemonic neoliberal and biopolitical projects. Where James sees the normcore averageness of Taylor Swift and Spandau Ballet as contributing to the sonic episteme's marginalization of nonnormative conceptions of gender, race, and personhood, the black feminist political ontologies she identifies in Beyoncé's and Rihanna's music challenge such marginalization. In using sound to theorize political ontology, subjectivity, and power, James argues for the further articulation of sonic practices that avoid contributing to the systemic relations of domination that biopolitical neoliberalism creates and polices.},

Moreover, the scale and delicate shading of the originals render them needlessly difficult for the field student of bird song to interpret, and needlessly expensive for journals to reproduce. A simplified and graphic notation, consisting of a series of conventional symbols, has been worked out. This, it is believed, largely overcomes these difficulties without the loss of any information essential for the field student.},

Individuals can differ in their repertoire of musical behaviours as well as in the level of skill they display for any single musical behaviour. The types of musical behaviours we refer to here are broad, ranging from performance on an instrument and listening expertise, to the ability to employ music in functional settings or to communicate about music. In this paper, we first describe the concept of ‘musical sophistication’ which can be used to describe the multi-faceted nature of musical expertise. Next, we develop a novel measurement instrument, the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI) to assess self-reported musical skills and behaviours on multiple dimensions in the general population using a large Internet sample (n = 147,636). Thirdly, we report results from several lab studies, demonstrating that the Gold-MSI possesses good psychometric properties, and that self-reported musical sophistication is associated with performance on two listening tasks. Finally, we identify occupation, occupational status, age, gender, and wealth as the main socio-demographic factors associated with musical sophistication. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical accounts of implicit and statistical music learning and with regard to social conditions of sophisticated musical engagement.},

His book is an approachable and essential guide to the strategic, technical, and philosophical foundations of this new medium.”  Derek Thompson (Atlantic staff writer and national best-selling author of Hit Makers): “This book feels like a rare achievement: a definitive statement about an emerging phenomenon that could shape the digital world, the global economy, and the very experience of human consciousness.”  From the leading theorist of the Metaverse comes the definitive account of the next internet: what the Metaverse is, what it will take to build it, and what it means for all of us. The term “Metaverse” is suddenly everywhere, from the front pages of national newspapers and the latest fashion trends to the plans of the most powerful companies in history. It is already shaping the policy platforms of the US government, the European Union, and the Chinese Communist Party. But what, exactly, is the Metaverse? As pioneering theorist and venture capitalist Matthew Ball explains, it is a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences, and also underpin much of the physical world. For decades, these ideas have been limited to science fiction and video games, but they are now poised to revolutionize every industry and function, from finance and healthcare to education, consumer products, city planning, dating, and well beyond. Taking us on an expansive tour of the “next internet,” Ball demonstrates that many proto-Metaverses are already here, such as Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox. Yet these offer only a glimpse of what is to come. Ball presents a comprehensive definition of the Metaverse before explaining the technologies that will power it—and the breakthroughs that will be necessary to fully realize it. He addresses the governance challenges the Metaverse entails; investigates the role of Web3, blockchains, and NFTs; and predicts Metaverse winners and losers. Most importantly, he examines many of the Metaverse’s almost unlimited applications. The internet will no longer be at arm’s length; instead, it will surround us, with much of our lives, labor, and leisure taking place inside the Metaverse. Bringing clarity and authority to a frequently misunderstood concept, Ball foresees trillions of dollars in new value—and the radical reshaping of society.},

To support the MER research which requires large music content libraries, we present the PMEmo dataset containing emotion annotations of 794 songs as well as the simultaneous electrodermal activity (EDA) signals. A Music Emotion Experiment was well-designed for collecting the affective-annotated music corpus of high quality, which recruited 457 subjects. The dataset is publically available to the research community, which is foremost intended for benchmarking in music emotion retrieval and recognition. To straightforwardly evaluate the methodologies for music affective analysis, it also involves pre-computed audio feature sets. In addition to that, manually selected chorus excerpts (compressed in MP3) of songs are provided to facilitate the development of chorus-related research. In this article, We describe in detail the resource acquisition, subject selection, experiment design and annotation collection procedures, as well as the dataset content and data reliability analysis. We also illustrate its usage in some simple music emotion recognition tasks which testified the PMEmo dataset's competence for the MER work. Compared to other homogeneous datasets, PMEmo is novel in the organization and management of the recruited annotators, and it is also characterized by its large amount of music with simultaneous physiological signals.},

For each song, the dataset contains a musical score for four instrument voices as well as expressive attributes for the dynamics and timbre of each voice.

Alongside the dataset, we provide a tool that renders generated compositions as NESstyle audio by emulating the device’s audio processor.

	abstract = {Joint improvisation is the creative action of two or more people without a script or designated leader. Examples include improvisational theater and music, and day-to-day activities such as conversations. In joint improvisation, novel action is created, emerging from the interaction between people. Although central to creative processes and social interaction, joint improvisation remains largely unexplored due to the lack of experimental paradigms. Here we introduce a paradigm based on a theater practice called the mirror game. We measured the hand motions of two people mirroring each other at high temporal and spatial resolution. We focused on expert actors and musicians skilled in joint improvisation. We found that players can jointly create novel complex motion without a designated leader, synchronized to less than 40 ms. In contrast, we found that designating one player as leader deteriorated performance: The follower showed 2–3 Hz oscillation around the leader's smooth trajectory, decreasing synchrony and reducing the range of velocities reached. A mathematical model suggests a mechanism for these observations based on mutual agreement on future motion in mirrored reactive–predictive controllers. This is a step toward understanding the human ability to create novelty by improvising together.},

	abstract = {The essays collected in this new volume reveal Isaiah Berlin at his most lucid and accessible. He was constitutionally incapable of writing with the opacity of the specialist, but these shorter, more introductory pieces provide the perfect starting-point for the reader new to his work. Those who are already familiar with his writing will also be grateful for this further addition to his collected essays. The connecting theme of these essays, as in the case of earlier volumes, is the crucial social and political role--past, present and future--of ideas, and of their progenitors. A rich variety of subject-matters is represented--from philosophy to education, from Russia to Israel, from Marxism to romanticism--so that the truth of Heine's warning is exemplified on a broad front. It is a warning that Berlin often referred to, and provides an answer to those who ask, as from time to time they do, why intellectual history matters. Among the contributions are "My Intellectual Path," Berlin's last essay, a retrospective autobiographical survey of his main preoccupations; and "Jewish Slavery and Emancipation," the classic statement of his Zionist views, long unavailable in print. His other subjects include the Enlightenment, Giambattista Vico, Vissarion Belinsky, Alexander Herzen, G.V. Plekhanov, the Russian intelligentsia, the idea of liberty, political realism, nationalism, and historicism. The book exhibits the full range of his enormously wide expertise and demonstrates the striking and enormously engaging individuality, as well as the power, of his own ideas. "Over a hundred years ago, the German poet Heine warned the French not to underestimate the power of ideas: philosophical concepts nurtured in the stillness of a professor's study could destroy a civilization."--Isaiah Berlin, Two Concepts of Liberty, 1958. This new edition adds a number of previously uncollected pieces, including Berlin's earliest statement of the pluralism of values for which he is famous.},

Hal Leonard is very proud to present the first legitimate and legal editions of these books ever produced. You won't even notice the difference, other than that all of the notorious errors have been fixed: the covers and typeface look the same, the song list is nearly identical, and the price for our edition is even cheaper than the original! Every conscientious musician will appreciate that these books are now produced accurately and ethically, benefitting the songwriters that we owe for some of the greatest tunes of all time! Includes 400 songs: All Blues * Au Privave * Autumn Leaves * Black Orpheus * Bluesette * Body and Soul * Bright Size Life * Con Alma * Dolphin Dance * Don't Get Around Much Anymore * Easy Living * Epistrophy * Falling in Love with Love * Footprints * Four on Six * Giant Steps * Have You Met Miss Jones? * How High the Moon * I'll Remember April * Impressions * Lullaby of Birdland * Misty * My Funny Valentine * Oleo * Red Clay * Satin Doll * Sidewinder * Stella by Starlight * Take Five * There Is No Greater Love * Wave * and hundreds more!

This study of the subtlety, complexity, and variety of modes of hearing maps out a "sonorous archipelago"-a heterogeneous set of shifting sonic territories shaped by the vicissitudes of desire and discourse.Profoundly intimate yet immediately giving onto distant spaces, both an "organ of fear" and an echo chamber of anticipated pleasures, an uncontrollable flow subject to unconscious selection and augmentation, the subtlety, complexity, and variety of modes of hearing has meant that sound has rarely received the same philosophical attention as the visual.In The Order of Sounds, Francois J. Bonnet makes a compelling case for the irreducible heterogeneity of "sound," navigating between the physical models constructed by psychophysics and refined through recording technologies, and the synthetic production of what is heard. From primitive vigilance and sonic mythologies to digital sampling and sound installations, he examines the ways in which we make sound speak to us, in an analysis of listening as a plurivocal phenomenon drawing on Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, Barthes, Nancy, Adorno, and de Certeau, and experimental pioneers such as Tesla, Bell, and Raudive. Stringent critiques of the "soundscape" and "reduced listening" demonstrate that univocal ontologies of sound are always partial and politicized; for listening is always a selective fetishism, a hallucination of sound filtered by desire and convention, territorialized by discourse and its authorities.Bonnet proposes neither a disciplined listening that targets sound "itself," nor an "ocean of sound" in which we might lose ourselves, but instead maps out a sonorous archipelago-a heterogeneous set of shifting sonic territories shaped and aggregated by the vicissitudes of desire and discourse.},

In it, Hegel proposed an arresting and novel picture of the relation of mind to world and of people to each other. Like Kant before him, Hegel offered up a systematic account of the nature of knowledge, the influence of society and history on claims to knowledge, and the social character of human agency itself. A bold new understanding of what, after Hegel, came to be called 'subjectivity' arose from this work, and it was instrumental in the formation of later philosophies, such as existentialism, Marxism, and American pragmatism, each of which reacted to Hegel's radical claims in different ways. This edition offers a new translation, an introduction, and glossaries to assist readers' understanding of this central text, and will be essential for scholars and students of Hegel},

	abstract = {This paper examines Research Through Design as an orientation to so-called 'Third Wave' Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A number of recent critical reflections are reviewed and the 'disciplinary anxieties', which this approach to HCI has aroused, are discussed. Drawing on Feyerabend's philosophical scepticism over methods and contributions to the Sociology of Science, it is suggested that design research might build its own 'limited rationality' rather than be brought in line with supposed norms for good research or criteria for rigour and relevance of unfamiliar provenance. To this end, a concept of 'annotated portfolio' is advanced, and detailed, as a means for capturing the family resemblances that exist in a collection of artefacts, simultaneously respecting the particularity of specific designs and engaging with broader concerns. The concept is demonstrated through annotating nine well-known pieces created by the Goldsmiths Interaction Research Studio. Treating this collection as an annotated portfolio highlights, formulates and collates interaction design issues in this work in a novel manner. On this basis, annotated portfolios are proposed as a viable means for communicating design thinking in HCI in a descriptive yet generative and inspirational fashion, without having recourse to standards of 'theory' which fit design practice uncomfortably.},

The studies are part of a body of work that explores this complex and technically challenging domain and explicates the ways in which the actors involved address the tension between artistic and engineering practices. This report focusses on the flow of work in the creation of a song in a digital audio workstation (DAW), which often eschews the technical requirement to document the process to maintain a creative “vibe”, and the troubles that occur in subsequent stages of the production process in which complex and often messy compositions of audio data are handed over. We conclude with implications for metadata used in the process, namely the labelling and organisation of audio, to drive tools that allow more control over the creative process by automating process tracking and documenting song data provenance.},

In this work, we tackle a comprehensive understanding of how the intersections of users, roles, interactions, and technologies form a design space for CSTs. We accomplish this by reviewing 111 art-creation CSTs from HCI and computing research and analyzing how diverse aspects of CSTs relate to each other. Our findings identify patterns for designing CSTs, which can give guidance to future CST designers. We also highlight under-explored types of CSTs within the HCI community, providing future directions that CST researchers can pursue given the current trajectory of technological advancement.

Second, the limits of panopticism, and by extension liberal governance, are explored through analysis of Gilles Deleuze's account of the shift from disciplinary to ?control? societies, and Zygmunt Bauman's writings on individualization and the ?Synopticon?. In response to Deleuze and Bauman, the final section of this paper returns to Foucault's lectures on biopolitics to argue that contemporary capitalist society is characterized not simply by the decline of state powers (the control society) or the passing down of responsibilities from the state to the individual (the individualization thesis), but by the neoliberal marketization of the state and its institutions; a development which is underpinned by a specific form of governmentality. In conclusion, a four-fold typology of surveillance is advanced: surveillance as discipline, as control, as interactivity, and as a mechanism for promoting competition.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws upon a range of literary examples and from biographical accounts of authors such as Alan Bennett, Michel Foucault, and Umberto Eco to show how the library space operates as a heterotopia. Findings – The paper finds that drawing together the constructs of heterotopia and serendipity can enrich the understanding of how libraries are experienced as sites of play, creativity, and adventure. Originality/value – Foucault’s concept of heterotopia is offered as an original and useful frame that can account for the range of experiences and associations uniquely attached to the library.},

This article examines the No Impact Man (NIM) experiment both as “alternative hedonism,” a reconceptualization of the “good life” that avoids unduly damaging the natural world, and also as a kind of “eco-stunt,” an attempt to garner significant media coverage about positive environmental behaviors. We use DeLuca's theorization of the “image event” to analyze the No Impact Man franchise—blog, book, and documentary film—though we modify that theory in order to explore how No Impact Man functions as multi-media and new-media spectacle. In particular, we explore the risky double-bind Beavan finds himself in when, through his choice to publicize the NIM eco-stunt, he is critiqued for opportunism, foolishness, and insincerity. We suggest that efforts to publicize eco-stunts, however well conceived, invariably invite backlash. As a result, we find that alternative hedonism theory and practice open a space of invitation to environmentally beneficial behaviors and attitudes that could have potential with some audiences, but their mass appeal is compromised by the limitations of the stunts that publicize them.},

In this paper we will trace the exact history of their introduction. We will see that between 1896 and 1898, Russell had a well-elaborated theory of »sense-data«, which he abandoned after his analytic turn of the summer of 1898. However, following his new turn of August 1900 – after he became acquainted with the works of Giuseppe Peano and later of Gottlob Frege – Russell gradually developed a new, second theory of sense-data. He reintroduced the term »sense-data« in 1911 with the crucial help of his friend George Edward Moore. In parallel, Russell also introduced the epistemological term »knowledge by acquaintance«, which came to designate, above all, the grasping of sense-data.]},

	abstract = {Damage to the hippocampus in humans can cause profound impairments in long-term episodic memory, but the precise functional contribution of the hippocampus remains the subject of several competing theories.Electrophysiological studies in rodents have characterized the firing properties of 'place cells' in the hippocampus in great detail. Place cells appear to represent where an animal 'thinks' it is located in an environment, relative to environmental boundaries. Acting cooperatively, place cells encode specific environments, performing both pattern completion and pattern separation.A new model of hippocampal processing that is driven by the properties of place cells (the BBB model) provides an alternative to existing psychological theories, at least in the spatial domain. The BBB model proposes that the hippocampus is needed to impose a location from which to retrieve and construct a coherent mental image of an environment. This mental image supports the online maintenance and manipulation of representations of the locations of objects and features in an environment.The model suggests that episodic memory will always be hippocampus-dependent if it is associated with rich mental imagery of an environment. Other sophisticated long-term spatial (and non-spatial) representations can be acquired, stored and retrieved independent of the hippocampus. However, the hippocampus is often needed to mediate behaviours that allow such learning to take place (such as when learning a new route).The BBB model further suggests that the hippocampus is required for both short-term and long-term memory for some types of information, for imagining complex visual scenes (be they real or fictitious), and more for the recognition of scenes than faces. Recent experimental evidence from studies of the effects of damage to the hippocampus in humans supports all three of these proposals.Hippocampal processing beyond the spatial domain cannot be explained by the BBB model, but several theoretical positions have been advanced to address the broader role of the hippocampus in mnemonic processing.},

	abstract = {1. The songs and other vocalisations of birds are of theoretical interest to zoologists and psychologists (1) as social communication systems and as a “language”; (2) as specific and inter-specific recognition marks; (3) as a problem in the inheritance and genetical control of elaborate behaviour patterns; and (4) as a problem in the acquistion of complex behaviour patterns by individual learning. The last two constitute the main objects of this work. 2. The Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs was chosen as the main subject of investigation because its song displays both inherited and individually learned components, the relation between which is of particular interest. It is considered that neither a chain reflex type of theory nor one of reflex conditioning in the ordinary sense will provide satisfactory explanation of song production. 3. The characteristics and normal limits of variation of song of wild F. c. coelebs and F. c. gengleri are described and illustrated. There is no certain means of distinguishing the songs of these two subspecies but fairly consistent local differences occur. A wild male Chaffinch usually has more than one song type and may have as many as six. Full song is practically unknown in the female. 4. The song of insular species and sub-species and of artificially isolated populations tend to be simpler and less variable than examples from the Continent, possibly because, in a less dense population in an ecologically simpler environment, an individually distinctive territorial proclamation will not be so important for breeding success. 5. Experiments with F. c. gengleri were carried out in aviaries, bird rooms and cages. None of these techniques had any seriously adverse effect on the drive to sing. The onset of song could be controlled experimentally by crowding, by artificial control of daily illumination in a light-proof room and by injection of testosterone propionate. 6. Birds caught as juveniles in their first autumn and isolated until the summer following produced nearly normal songs that are almost as elaborate as are those of wild Chaffinches. If such birds, instead of being individually isolated, are kept together in groups in such a manner that they can hear only the songs of the members of their own group, these birds (as a result of counter-singing) copy one another and so come to produce a fairly uniform community pattern. Close matching of the final phrase of the song is particularly evident. 7. Birds which have been hand-reared in auditory isolation from the fifth day of life produce extremely simple songs which represent the inborn component of the specific song. If such Kaspar Hauser birds are themselves grouped together in isolated communities from the third to the thirteenth month of life, each group will-during the period February to May—build up, by mutual stimulation and imitation, complex but highly abnormal songs quite dissimilar from those of normal wild Chaffinches. From this it is clear that in the wild young Chaffinches learn some features of the song from their male parents or from other adults during the first few weeks of life. But most of the finer detail of the song is learnt by the young bird when, in its first breeding season, it first comes to sing in competition with neighbouring territory holders. There is little doubt that this is the way in which local song-dialects are built up and perpetuated. Full Chaffinch song is thus an integration of inborn and learned song patterns, the former constituting the basis for the latter. 8. The subsong of the Chaffinch is of low intensity, entirely different in structure from the full song, and contains a much bigger range of frequencies. It seems to have no communicatory function. It is characteristic of the early spring of first-year birds, and also of low but increasing production of sex hormones in birds of all ages. It provides in some degree the raw material out of which, by practice and by the elimination of unwanted extremes of frequency, the full song is crystallised. 9. The use of call notes, which are innate, as components of subsong and full song is described. Call notes are more evident in the songs of Kaspar Hauser birds than they are in the songs of normal birds. This is presumably an expression of the reduced auditory experience of the hand-reared isolated birds. 10. Chaffinches are not “imitative” birds in that they do not normally copy anything but sounds of Chaffinch origin. Once a Chaffinch has heard Chaffinch song as a young bird in the wild, it appears to have learnt enough about it to refuse to copy any sound pattern which departs far from the normal, i.e. it will learn only the fine individual variations of the songs of other Chaffinches. So, in the wild, Chaffinches practically never, in their full songs, imitate anything but other Chaffinches. Kaspar Hauser birds will learn songs of far greater abnormality provided the tonal quality is not too different from that of Chaffinch song. Voices as “abnormal” as that of a Canary may be learned by hand-reared birds and very occasionally by wild birds but when this happens the alien notes are kept as components of the non-communicative subsong only; the full song is not contaminated with them. If the tonal quality is sufficiently close to that of the Chaffinch, as with the song of the Tree Pipit and as with artificial songs constructed from genuine Chaffinch notes and played to the hand-reared birds by means of the “Song Tutor”, they will be learned at least to some extent and the learned pattern will become part of the bird's full song. 11. Counter-singing that occurs between birds in adjacent territories is an important factor in stimulating and restricting the imitative abilities of Chaffinches. When a Chaffinch has acquired more than one song type, each song outburst consists of a sequence of one song type followed by a sequence of another. This can be largely understood on the basis of the inter-action of the self-stimulating and self-inhibitory effects which are a concomitant of each song type. When songs are played back to a Chaffinch we find that those songs which it uses most frequently itself are the most effective in evoking song. A Chaffinch in the wild will thus tend to reply to a neighbour with that song of its own repertoire which most nearly resembles the song of its rival. 12. It is suggested that with the more “imitative” finches such as Bullfinch, Hawfinch and to some extent Greenfinch, the song, while functional in co-ordinating the breeding cycle and behaviour of the mated pair, is of less importance as a territorial proclamation. Thus in some respects it resembles the subsong rather than the full song of the Chaffinch and similarly contamination with alien notes can be tolerated to an extent which might be highly disadvantageous in a highly territorial song. A preliminary study of a number of species of “Buntings” shows that many of the species, e.g. Reed and Corn Buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus and E. calandra) have songs which are highly stereotyped and completely innate. The song of the Yellow Bunting E. citrinella appears to consist of an integration of innate and learned components much as in the Chaffinch. The Buntings as a whole have highly territorial songs. 13. Apart from a very few and partial exceptions, Chaffinches can only learn song patterns during the first 13 months of life and towards the end of this time there is a peak period of learning activity of a few weeks during which a young Chaffinch may learn, as a result of singing in a territory, the fine details of as many as six different songs. This special period of high learning ability is brought to an abrupt close by internal factors. This restriction of learning ability to a particular type of object and to a sharply defined sensitive period recalls the phenomenon of imprinting. 14. The inborn recognition and performance of the specific song pattern by the Chaffinch involves (a) duration of approximately 2 1/2 secs., (b) interval between songs of approximately 10–20 secs., (c) tonal quality (though this last may have been learned by the bird's experience of the qualities of its own voice). The readiness with which the bird learns to divide its song into three sections and learns to attach a simple flourish to the end as an appropriate termination suggests that there may be a very imperfectly inherited tendency to respond to and perform these features of the normal song which is revealed as soon as the singer is stimulated by hearing another bird.},

Whether the data involve text, neuroimaging, neural networks, or human judgments, researchers frequently infer and analyze latent representational spaces (i.e., embeddings). However, the properties of a latent representation (e.g., prediction performance, interpretability, compactness) depend on the inference procedure, which can vary widely across endeavors. For example, dimensions are not always globally interpretable and the dimensionality of different embeddings may not be readily comparable. Moreover, the dichotomy between multidimensional spaces and purportedly richer representational formats, such as graph representations, is misleading.

	abstract = {This article discusses both sample-based and electronic music in relation to Walter Benjamin’s infamous text, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” The applicability of “aura” to such music is questioned, in favour of other considerations, such as practices of collecting, remembering, selecting, and connecting. The relationships between performance, “liveness,” and technologically enabled forms of music are explored. Authors who have written about Benjamin’s text in relation to modern audio (re)production are compared and contrasted. I also reference interviews I conducted with a group of sample-based sound artists from Montréal, Canada, between 2004 and 2005. My discussion brings me to Benjamin’s use of Leonardo da Vinci’s disparaging comments about music compared with painting in the latter’s Paragone. I conclude by asserting that Benjamin’s practice of quotation is more relevant than his conception of “aura” in terms of discussing “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” in relation to contemporary, reproduction-based artistic practices such as electronic and/or sample-based music.},

	abstract = {Compared task outcome and various dialog parameters between situations in which task participants (64 undergraduates) either could or could not see each other. The visibility of one's conversational partner improved information transfer and the management of turn taking in a transactional problem-solving task. The greater efficiency of the dialogs between Ss who could see each other was attributed to the exchange of visually transmitted, nonverbal signals. In attempting to compensate for the lack of this additional channel of communication, pairs of Ss who could not see each other demonstrated flexibility and versatility in communicating. They interrupted their partners more frequently and used more back channel responses to provide their partners with increased verbal feedback. The analysis of a subsample of the dialogs suggests that gaze plays a role in aiding communication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

It is shown here that the structure of the Euclidean algorithm may be used to generate, very efﬁciently, a large family of rhythms used as timelines (ostinatos), in sub-Saharan African music in particular, and world music in general. These rhythms, here dubbed Euclidean rhythms, have the property that their onset patterns are distributed as evenly as possible. Euclidean rhythms also ﬁnd application in nuclear physics accelerators and in computer science, and are closely related to several families of words and sequences of interest in the study of the combinatorics of words, such as Euclidean strings, to which the Euclidean rhythms are compared.},

The new edition retains all of this, while also adding 100 pages, 93 figures, 225 new references, and six new chapters covering topics such as meter and metric complexity, rhythmic grouping, expressive timbre and timing in rhythmic performance, and evolution phylogenetic analysis of ancient Greek paeonic rhythms. In addition, further context is provided to give the reader a fuller and richer insight into the historical connections between music and mathematics.},

	abstract = {A growing number of musicians are recognising the importance of re-thinking notation and its capacity to support contemporary practice. New music is increasingly more collaborative and polystylistic, engaging a greater range of sounds from both acoustic and electronic instruments. Contemporary compositional approaches combine composition, improvisation, found sounds, production and multimedia elements, but common practice music notation has not evolved to reflect these developments. While traditional notations remain the most effective way to communicate information about tempered harmony and the subdivision of metre for acoustic instruments, graphic and animated notations may provide an opportunity for the representation and communication of electronic music. If there is a future for notating electronic music, the micro-tonality, interactivity, non-linear structures, improvisation, aleatoricism and lack of conventional rhythmic structures that are features of it will not be facilitated by common practice notation. This article proposes that graphic and animated notations do have this capacity to serve electronic music, and music that combines electronic and acoustic instruments, as they enable increased input from performers from any musical style, reflect the collaborative practices that are a signpost of current music practice. This article examines some of the ways digitally rendered graphic and animated notations can represent contemporary electronic music-making and foster collaboration between musicians and composers of different musical genres, integrating electronic and acoustic practices.},

	abstract = {This first volume of this new Divine Comedy presents the Italian text of the Inferno and, on facing pages, a new prose translation (the first in twenty-five years). Robert Durling's translation brings a new power and accuracy to the rendering of Dante's extraordinary vision of Hell, with all its terror, pathos, and sardonic humor, and its penetrating analyses of the psychology of sin and the ills that plague society. Martinez and Durling's introduction and notes are designed with the first-time reader of the poem in mind but will be useful to others as well. The concise introduction presents essential biographical and historical background and a discussion of the form of the poem. The notes are more extensive than those in most translations currently available, and they contain much new material. In addition, sixteen short essays explore the autobiographical dimension of the poem, the problematic body analogy, the question of Christ's presence in Hell, and individual cantos that have been the subject of controversy, including those on homosexuality. There is an extensive bibliography, and the four indexes (to foreign words, passages cited, proper names in the notes, and to proper names in the text and translation) will make the volume particularly useful. Robert Turner's illustrations include detailed maps of Italy, clearly labeled diagrams of the cosmos and of the structure of Hell, and line drawings illustrating objects and places mentioned in the poem},

	isbn = {978-0-19-953564-4},
	abstract = {Described variously as the greatest poem of the European Middle Ages and, because of the author's evangelical purpose, the `fifth Gospel', the Divine Comedy is central to the culture of the west. The poem is a spiritual autobiography in the form of a journey - the poet travels from the dark circles of the Inferno, up the mountain of Purgatory, where Virgil, his guide leaves him to encounter Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise. Dante conceived the poem as the new epic of Christendom, and he creates a world in which reason and faith have transformed moral and social chaos into order.  Charles Sisson's blank verse translation is remarkable for its lucidity and vigour, and the Introduction, diagrams, maps, and notes by David Higgins provide the reader with invaluable guidance.  ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.},

	abstract = {This first volume of this new Divine Comedy presents the Italian text of the Inferno and, on facing pages, a new prose translation (the first in twenty-five years). Robert Durling's translation brings a new power and accuracy to the rendering of Dante's extraordinary vision of Hell, with all its terror, pathos, and sardonic humor, and its penetrating analyses of the psychology of sin and the ills that plague society. Martinez and Durling's introduction and notes are designed with the first-time reader of the poem in mind but will be useful to others as well. The concise introduction presents essential biographical and historical background and a discussion of the form of the poem. The notes are more extensive than those in most translations currently available, and they contain much new material. In addition, sixteen short essays explore the autobiographical dimension of the poem, the problematic body analogy, the question of Christ's presence in Hell, and individual cantos that have been the subject of controversy, including those on homosexuality. There is an extensive bibliography, and the four indexes (to foreign words, passages cited, proper names in the notes, and to proper names in the text and translation) will make the volume particularly useful. Robert Turner's illustrations include detailed maps of Italy, clearly labeled diagrams of the cosmos and of the structure of Hell, and line drawings illustrating objects and places mentioned in the poem},

Various approaches and models of environmental psychology, as well as approaches to usability and UX are outlined in light of the need to highlight the influence and effects of particular spatial designs to particular dimensions of UX.

It will also discuss Barthes’ notion of ‘myth’ and its influence as a concept.

If we consider that, in conventional music notation, the musical symbol is indeed a visual object, but is undoubtedly linked to the sound that is heard, Kim's work challenges the relationship between music notation and the hearing body that is usually taken for granted. Furthermore, Kim's music notations allow us to ‘read’ her musical ideas and imaginations that come from the perspective of sign language, which is rooted in Deaf culture.},

Simultaneously, BCM pursues sparsity by learning subspaces, the sets of features that play important roles in the characterization of the prototypes. The prototype and subspace representation provides quantitative benefits in interpretability while preserving classification accuracy.

	abstract = {The advent of computing stimulates a desire to re-examine the subject of creativity. Though the computer can replace man in the production of graphic images, its function in the arts is seen as assisting in the specification of art systems and in their subsequent real-time management. An art of system or process is placed in the context of primarily the visual or plastic arts but the authors disavow concern with any 'new' or 'modern technological' art. Various types of art systems are mentioned and advantages of the fully interactive one are considered. It is pointed out that the inclusion of complex real-time responses in an interactive art system can frequently make use of a computer. In such work, the artist and the viewer play an integral part. The traditional role of the artist, composer or writer is thus called into question; it may no longer be necessary to assume that he is a specialist in art--rather he is a catalyst of creative activity. Three cases are discussed to illustrate the applications of this approach. /// L'avènement de l'informatique exige que l'on reconsidère le problème de la créativité. Bien que l'ordinateur puisse remplacer l'homme dans la production d'images graphiques, on peut penser que sa fonction dans les arts est d'aider à spécifier les systèmes artistiques, et à les répartir ultérieurement dans le temps réel. Un art du système et du processus se situe d'abord dans le contexte des arts visuels ou plastiques; cependant la préoccupation des auteurs n'est d'aucune manière un art 'nouveau' ou 'technologique'. Ils citent plusieurs sortes de systèmes artistiques et décrivent les avantages de celui qui est entièrement 'interactif'. Ils font remarquer que l'inclusion de réponses complexes du temps réel dans un système artistique interactif peut souvent appeler l'utilisation d'un ordinateur. Dans une telle œuvre, l'artiste et le spectateur jouent un rôle à part entière. Le rôle traditionnel de l'artiste, du compositeur ou de l'écrivain est ainsi remis en question; il n'est plus nécessaire d'affirmer que l'artiste est un spécialiste--il est plutôt le catalyseur d'une activité créatrice. Trois exemples illustrent les applications de cette approche.},

Based on an ethnography of jazz jam sessions, as well as a relatively novel set of interviews in which informants listen to and comment upon recordings of their own recent performances, the dissertation discuss how people, even those who have no prior acquaintance or formal ties with one another, can come together, make their intentions known to one another, and produce coherent products, in this case musical performances, with one another. Findings suggest that three key processes facilitate the coordination of interaction: (1) Participants pay attention to context; (2) People interpret the actions of others as meaningful signs to which to respond; And (3) People use their experiences in various different kinds of activities to help them make sense of difficult interactions through the use of metaphors.
In all these situations certain social structures facilitate interactions. These structures inhere in such things as the metaphors that are commonly used in the speech of jazz musicians, the structure of the sessions themselves, and understandings that individual musicians gain through socialization in the performance of jazz and through formal training and apprenticeships with older musicians. But these structures are flexible. People are able to exercise a great degree of personal agency in interactions, creatively producing group performances.},

Short fragments of music, which are characteristic of lesson activity, can also function as turns in themselves as student-tutor dialogue unfolds. When the medium for communication is changed and we analyse video mediated music lessons, these mechanisms are less effective, revealing the importance of this organization to lesson flow, and to musical interaction more generally.},

	abstract = {Artificial-life research was founded in the mid-1980s. It promotes the idea of the bottom-up research approach, where only the basic units of a situation and their local interaction are modelled, and then the system is left to evolve. However, the notable progress of the processing power of personal computers, evident in the last two decades, has had little influence on the ways the basic units (artificial animals or animats) are constructed. This impacts largely on the applicability of the methods in other research fields. Our field of choice is the modelling of bird flocks. This area was at its peak in the late 1980s when Craig W. Reynolds presented the first and most influential model – the boids. In spite of his many following works no formal definition has ever been presented. This might be the reason why a second generation of flocking models is still awaited. In this article we make a step forward, all in view of allowing for the development of the second-generation models. We present an artificial animal construction framework that has been obtained as a generalization of the existing bird flocking models, but is not limited to them. The article thus presents a formal definition of the framework and gives an example of its use. In the latter the framework is employed to present a formalization of Reynolds's boids.},

	abstract = {The Conversation is a 1974 American mystery thriller film written, produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Gene Hackman with supporting roles by John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest, Harrison Ford, Teri Garr and Robert Duvall.
The plot revolves around a surveillance expert and the moral dilemma he faces when his recordings reveal a potential murder. Coppola cited the 1966 film Blowup as a key influence. However, since the film was released to theaters just a few months before Richard Nixon resigned as president, he felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to the Watergate scandal. 
The Conversation has won critical acclaim  and multiple accolades, including the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the highest honor at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. It was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1974 and lost Best Picture to The Godfather Part II, another Francis Ford Coppola film. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".},

	title = {The {Concept} of the {Aesthetic}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/aesthetic-concept/},
	abstract = {Introduced into the philosophical lexicon during the EighteenthCentury, the term ‘aesthetic’ has come to be used todesignate, among other things, a kind of object, a kind of judgment, akind of attitude, a kind of experience, and a kind of value. For themost part, aesthetic theories have divided overquestions particular to one or another of these designations:whether artworks are necessarily aesthetic objects; how to square theallegedly perceptual basis of aesthetic judgments with the fact thatwe give reasons in support of them; how best to capture the elusivecontrast between an aesthetic attitude and a practical one; whether todefine aesthetic experience according to its phenomenological orrepresentational content; how best to understand the relation betweenaesthetic value and aesthetic experience. But questions ofmore general nature have lately arisen, and these have tendedto have a skeptical cast: whether any use of ‘aesthetic’may be explicated without appeal to some other; whether agreementrespecting any use is sufficient to ground meaningful theoreticalagreement or disagreement; whether the term ultimately answers to anylegitimate philosophical purpose that justifies its inclusion in thelexicon. The skepticism expressed by such general questions did notbegin to take hold until the later part of the 20th century, and thisfact prompts the question whether (a) the concept of the aesthetic isinherently problematic and it is only recently that we have managed tosee that it is, or (b) the concept is fine and it is only recentlythat we have become muddled enough to imagine otherwise. Adjudicatingbetween these possibilities requires a vantage from which to take inboth early and late theorizing on aesthetic matters.},

Special attention is devoted to problems in the interpretation of Hegel: the unity of the Phenomenology of Spirit; the value of the dialectical method; the status of his logic; the nature of his politics. A final group of chapters treats Hegel's complex historical legacy: the development of Hegelianism and its growth into a left and right-wing school; the relation of Hegel and Marx; and the subtle connections between Hegel and contemporary analytic philosophy},

Innovations result from costly R\&D investments and move technology up one step. Competition is inversely measured by the ex post rents for firms that operate at the same technological level, i.e. for neck-and-neck firms. First, we find that increased competition leads to a significant increase in R\&D investments by neck-and-neck firms. Second, increased competition decreases R\&D investments by firms that are lagging behind, in particular if the time horizon is short. Third, we find that increased competition affects industry composition by reducing the fraction of sectors where firms are neck-and-neck. All these results are consistent with the predictions of step-by-step innovation models.},

All three elements are to be found in the work of Karl Marx. Marx's analysis of the crisis of the earth (or soil) in the mid-nineteenth century led him to a concept of sustainability that was central to his vision of communist society. Because this concept of sustainability was rooted both in a critique of capitalism and a vision of a future society, it has a richness and complexity all its own. A close examination of Marx's concept of sustainability therefore offers important insights into the possibilities for the creation of a more sustainable social order.},

Second, I discuss the logic of domains in contemporary computer, information, and data science circles. While STS is often agnostic about the borders between the sciences or with industry and state—occasionally taking those boundaries as an object of study—data science takes those boundaries as its target to overcome. These two elective affinities present analytic and practical challenges for STS but also opportunities for engagement. Overall, in addition to these typifications, I urge STS scholars to strategically position themselves to investigate and contribute to the breadth of transformations that seek to touch virtually every science and newly bind spheres of academy, industry, and state.},

We describe two phases of our experimentation. Firstly we worked with a composer to explore diﬀerent training datasets and parameters. Secondly, we extended DDSP models with network bending functionality, which allows us to feed additional control data into the network’s hidden layers and achieve new timbral eﬀects. We describe several possible network bending techniques and how they aﬀect the sound.},

This is the case if sophisticated thermodynamic models are integrated as e.g. the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state. When constructing surrogate models, the question of how to choose the training set arises. Recent research showed that promising results were obtained using adaptive or sequential sampling methods. In these approaches, the surrogate model predictions are used to identify additional promising sample locations. The results depend on the structure of the surrogate model, i.e. the choice of the hyperparameters. It is in general a tedious task to choose hyperparameters by trial and error, and a set of hyperparameters that is suitable in the initial phase may not be adequate anymore when the size of the training set increases significantly. Therefore, we here propose a methodology to incorporate hyperparameter optimization (HPO) into the adaptive sampling workflow. As this comes with a significant effort, HPO is only performed when it promises improvements.},

Many fail to meet these expectations. We argue here that the well-documented failures of ICTs in healthcare are partly attributable to the philosophical foundations of much health informatics research. Positivistic assumptions underpinning the design, implementation and evaluation of ICTs (in particular the notion that technology X has an impact which can be measured and reproduced in new settings), and the deterministic experimental and quasi-experimental study designs which follow from these assumptions, have inherent limitations when ICTs are part of complex social practices involving multiple human actors. We suggest that while experimental and quasi-experimental studies have an important place in health informatics research overall, ethnography is the preferred methodological approach for studying ICTs introduced into complex social systems. But for ethnographic approaches to be accepted and used to their full potential, many in the health informatics community will need to revisit their philosophical assumptions about what counts as research rigor.},

Integration was indexed by measuring the onset of speech with actions and speech with gestures (in milliseconds), with smaller differences reflecting a greater degree of synchrony. One hundred per cent of the subjects gestured in the gesture condition and performed actions in the action condition. Speech and gesture were more tightly synchronised than speech with action.

In order to guarantee reliability, we believe that the explanation should not change when we can guarantee that two networks process the images in identical manners. We show, through several examples, that saliency methods that do not satisfy this requirement result in misleading attribution.

	abstract = {Research in the social sciences has shown that expectations are an important factor in explanations as used between humans: rather than explaining the cause of an event per se, the explainer will often address another event that did not occur but that the explainee might have expected. For AI-powered systems, this finding suggests that explanation-generating systems may need to identify such end user expectations. In general, this is a challenging task, not the least because users often keep them implicit; there is thus a need to investigate the importance of such an ability. In this paper, we report an empirical study with 181 participants who were shown outputs from a text classifier system along with an explanation of why the system chose a particular class for each text. Explanations were both factual, explaining why the system produced a certain output or counterfactual, explaining why the system produced one output instead of another. Our main hypothesis was explanations should align with end user expectations; that is, a factual explanation should be given when the system's output is in line with end user expectations, and a counterfactual explanation when it is not. We find that factual explanations are indeed appropriate when expectations and output match. When they do not, neither factual nor counterfactual explanations appear appropriate, although we do find indications that our counterfactual explanations contained at least some necessary elements. Overall, this suggests that it is important for systems that create explanations of AI systems to infer what outputs the end user expected so that factual explanations can be generated at the appropriate moments. At the same time, this information is, by itself, not sufficient to also create appropriate explanations when the output and user expectations do not match. This is somewhat surprising given investigations of explanations in the social sciences, and will need more scrutiny in future studies.},

Although these methods are able to generate explanations for individual predictions, little research has been conducted to investigate the relationship of model accuracy and explanation quality, or how to use explanations to improve model performance. In this paper, we evaluate explanations using a metric based on area under the ROC curve (AUC), treating expert-provided image annotations as ground-truth explanations, and quantify the correlation between model accuracy and explanation quality when performing image classifications with deep neural networks. The experiments are conducted using two image datasets: the CUB-200-2011 dataset and a Kahikatea dataset that we publish with this paper. For each dataset, we compare and evaluate seven different neural networks with four different explainers in terms of both accuracy and explanation quality. We also investigate how explanation quality evolves as loss metrics change through the training iterations of each model. The experiments suggest a strong correlation between model accuracy and explanation quality. Based on this observation, we demonstrate how explanations can be exploited to benefit the model selection process—even if simply maximising accuracy on test data is the primary goal.},

	abstract = {Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high stakes decision-making throughout society, causing problems throughout healthcare, criminal justice, and in other domains. People have hoped that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of these problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practices and can potentially cause catastrophic harm to society. There is a way forward – it is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This manuscript clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare, and computer vision.},

	abstract = {In this article we shall deal with automatic classification of sound samples and ways to improve the classification results: We describe a classification process which produces high classification success percentage (over 95\% for musical instruments) and compare the results of three classification algorithms: Multidimensional Gauss, KNN and LVQ. Next, we introduce several algorithms to improve the sound database self-consistency by removing outliers: LOO, IQR and MIQR. We present our efficient process for Gradual Elimination of Descriptors using Discriminant Analysis (GDE) which improves a previous descriptor selection algorithm (Peeters and Rodet 2002). It also enables us to reduce the computation complexity and space requirements of a sound classification process according to specific accuracy needs. Moreover, it allows finding the dominant separating characteristics of the sound samples in a database according to classification taxonomy. The article ends by showing that good classification results do not necessarily mean generalized recognition of the dominant sound source characteristics, but the classifier might actually be focused on the specific attributes of the classified database. By enriching the learning database with diverse samples from other databases we obtain a more general classifier. The dominant descriptors provided by GDE are then more closely related to what is supposed to be the distinctive characteristics of the sound sources.},

Many fail to meet these expectations. We argue here that the well-documented failures of ICTs in healthcare are partly attributable to the philosophical foundations of much health informatics research. Positivistic assumptions underpinning the design, implementation and evaluation of ICTs (in particular the notion that technology X has an impact which can be measured and reproduced in new settings), and the deterministic experimental and quasi-experimental study designs which follow from these assumptions, have inherent limitations when ICTs are part of complex social practices involving multiple human actors. We suggest that while experimental and quasi-experimental studies have an important place in health informatics research overall, ethnography is the preferred methodological approach for studying ICTs introduced into complex social systems. But for ethnographic approaches to be accepted and used to their full potential, many in the health informatics community will need to revisit their philosophical assumptions about what counts as research rigor.},

	doi = {10.24908/ss.v16i2.8346},
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to revisit the metaphor of the Panopticon, borrowed by Michel Foucault from Jeremy Bentham to describe the development of disciplinary institutions in Western societies from the early nineteenth century, and to examine its relevance for the analysis of modern electronic means of surveillance. Widely used in the early stages of the study of new surveillance technologies, the metaphor of the Panopticon, particularly in the field of ‘surveillance studies,’ is growingly seen as inadequate to understand the impact of the latest surveillance tools and practices. This paper seeks to show that dominant interpretations of Foucault’s use of Panopticon as referring to techniques of domination or to ‘power over,’ while legitimate as regards some of his earlier writings, overlook Foucault’s later works on technologies of the self. That is, in Panoptic dispositifs in particular, as well as in settings involving power/knowledge configurations defining ‘normality’ more generally, individuals may end up exercising power over themselves without any coercion. It is argued here that the development of modern information and communication technologies may be said to produce a setting, the description of which as ‘panoptic’ is even more pertinent than was the case with respect to Western societies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Building upon recent empirical works on the ‘chilling effect,’ particularly in the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013, the article discusses modern technologies of the self—self-restraint and self-censorship—that new technologies, enabling different forms of surveillance, produce in Western societies. It also outlines the areas in which the notion of the Panopticon may be useful in terms of guiding research into self-discipline and self-restraint in the context of the proliferation of modern techniques of surveillance.},

	abstract = {This article reanimates the Adorno?Benjamin debate to investigate the potential of contemporary technologised consumer culture to become a space for bottom-up political agency and resistance. For both Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, the technological advancement of the 20th century had an inherently irrational character, as evidenced by the self-destructive tendencies of humanity during the Second World War. Nonetheless, the thinkers famously disagreed when it came to the implications of the marriage between technology and mass culture. Discerning its potential for the mobilisation of the masses, Benjamin believed that technology would politicise mass culture, allowing society to employ it for its political ends ? an idea which Adorno debunked. Technologised consumer culture has noticeably evolved since the time of the debate. Nevertheless, revisiting the debate is necessary to understand a contradiction between the expanded possibilities for political participation and the return of the ?auratic? or cultic function of technologised consumer culture. At the same time, the article shows that technology does politicise consumer culture. However, the pitfall lies in that the politicisation is done through technology as a tool, which is vulnerable to appropriation, granting those who are in the position to control it a substantial political resource. Consequently, the article argues that the politicisation of consumer culture risks having a reverse effect of facilitating the aestheticising of politics ? turning politics into a spectacle.},

Using the context of street art, we document four main ideologies of public space consumption that result from the interaction, both conflict and common intent, of urban dwellers and street artists. We show how public space can be contested as private and commercialized, or offered back as a collective good, where sense of belonging and dialogue restore it to a meaningful place. We demonstrate how the common nature of space both stimulates dialectical and dialogical exchanges across stakeholders and fuels forms of layered agency.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2204.07064},
	abstract = {Deep learning models are mostly used in an offline inference fashion. However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified training and can impact the resulting audio quality. In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and as a VST audio plugin. This allows to endow traditional digital audio workstation with real-time neural audio synthesis on a laptop CPU.},

	abstract = {For indoor settings, we investigate the impact of location on the spectral distribution of the received light, i.e., the intensity of light for different wavelengths. Our investigations confirm that even under the same light source, different locations exhibit slightly different spectral distribution due to reflections from their localised environment containing different materials or colours. By exploiting this observation, we propose Spectral-Loc, a novel indoor localization system that uses light spectral information to identify the location of the device. With spectral sensors finding their way into the latest products and applications, such as white balancing in smartphone photography, Spectral-Loc can be readily deployed without requiring any additional hardware or infrastructure. We prototype Spectral-Loc using a commercial-off-the-shelf light spectral sensor, AS7265x, which can measure light intensity over 18 different wavelength sub-bands. We benchmark the localization accuracy of Spectral-Loc against the conventional light intensity sensors that provide only a single intensity value. Our evaluations over two different indoor spaces, a meeting room, and a large office space, demonstrate that the use of light spectral information significantly reduces the localization error for the different percentiles.},

We are particularly interested in how musicians approach the design of new instruments when the sounds they make are constrained to recognisable material timbres and behaviours. We present a digital musical instrument (DMI) design study in which 20 participants design 80 new DMIs using an instrument kit. We use enactive approaches to design to enable the participants to borrow from everyday understandings of interaction in the real world, revealing aspects of their environment mediated purely through sound during the study tasks. We demonstrate that the influence of virtual material is strong, with participants not only taking material cues from the sound, but in places interaction strategies and performance approaches. We suggest that in addition to commonly referenced modalities of sight and touch, sound can be both precursor and mediator to our selection of, and gestural interaction with, materials at the design stage. We present two specific approaches to instrument design (Sound, Object Gesture – SOG, and Sound Gesture Object - SGO) which we found to underpin participant’s approaches to the design task and have wider effects on the instruments they designed, and the model of creativity employed in their use.},

This legacy means that its promise has the ability to evolve in accordance with our societal and cultural dreams and aspirations. It can reflect the current state of technological development, our hopes for that technology and also our fears; fundamentally though, after almost a century of media depictions and corporate promises, the robot is yet to enter our homes and lives in any meaningful way. This thesis begins by asking the question: how does an emerging technology (such as robotic) become a domestic product? In addressing this issue I draw from the theory of domestication and the method of speculative design to describe three possible technological journeys: how technology does not, does and could become a domestic product: 1. Technology does not make the transition from laboratory to domestic life. Robots have made countless departures from the habitat of the research laboratory, apparently headed towards the domestic habitat, but the vast majority never arrive. This observation leads to the identification of a third habitat and the current destination for the majority of proposed domestic robots – robot-related imaginaries.},

With reference to material sampling, some examples of remix, appropriation and quoting/sampling taking place within acousmatic music are highlighted. With regards to cultural citation, two levels of reference will be considered: cultural citation from sound arts, that is, intertextuality, and cultural citation from other media, that is, intermediality.

Originally, he did so in order to explicate the manifold connections between Afrofuturism and Techno, connecting them to Jazz, Breakbeat and Electronica. His argument, his narrations and his explorative language operations however inspired researchers, artists, and scholars since then. Sonic Fiction became a myth and a mantra, a keyword and a magical spell. This book provides a basic introduction to sonic fiction. In six chapters it explicates the inspirations for and the transformations of this concept; it explores applications and extrapolations in sound art and sonic theory, in musicology, epistemology, in critical and political theory. Sonic fiction is presented in this book as a heuristic for critique and activism.},

Though many experiments with data sonification have been explored in forums such as the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD), sonification faces many challenges to widespread use for presenting and analyzing data. For example, studies show it is difficult, but essential, to provide adequate context for interpreting sonifications of data.

This article reports on an analysis of primary and secondary microseisms (i.e., near and double the frequency of ocean swell) recorded simultaneously on three land-based long-period arrays (Alaskan Long Period Array, Montana Large Aperture Seismic Array, and Norwegian Seismic Array) during the early 1970s. Reliable microseism source locations are determined by wide-angle triangulation, using the azimuths of approach obtained from frequency-wave number analysis of the records of microseisms propagating across these arrays. Two near-shore sources of both primary and secondary microseisms appear to be persistent in the sense that they are associated with essentially constant near-shore locations. Secondary microseisms are observed to emanate from wide-ranging pelagic locations in addition to the same near-shore locations determined for the primary microseisms.},

Data sonification is a mapping from data generated by a model, captured in an experiment, or otherwise gathered through observation to one or more parameters of an audio signal or sound synthesis model for the purpose of better understanding, communicating, or reasoning about the original model, experiment, or system. Although data sonification shares techniques and materials with data-driven music, it is in the interests of the practitioners of both music composition and data sonification to maintain a distinction between the two fields.},

	abstract = {'Spaces Speak, Are You Listening?' establishes the concepts and language of aural architecture. These concepts provide an interdisciplinary guide for anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of how space enhances our well-being. We experience spaces not only by seeing but also by listening. We can navigate a room in the dark, and "hear" the emptiness of a house without furniture. Our experience of music in a concert hall depends on whether we sit in the front row or under the balcony. The unique acoustics of religious spaces acquire symbolic meaning. Social relationships are strongly influenced by the way that space changes sound. In Spaces Speak, Are You Listening?, Barry Blesser and Linda-Ruth Salter examine auditory spatial awareness: experiencing space by attentive listening. Every environment has an aural architecture.The audible attributes of physical space have always contributed to the fabric of human culture, as demonstrated by prehistoric multimedia cave paintings, classical Greek open-air theaters, Gothic cathedrals, acoustic geography of French villages, modern music reproduction, and virtual spaces in home theaters. Auditory spatial awareness is a prism that reveals a culture's attitudes toward hearing and space. Some listeners can learn to "see" objects with their ears, but even without training, we can all hear spatial geometry such as an open door or low ceiling.Integrating contributions from a wide range of disciplines--including architecture, music, acoustics, evolution, anthropology, cognitive psychology, audio engineering, and many others--Spaces Speak, Are You Listening? establishes the concepts and language of aural architecture. These concepts provide an interdisciplinary guide for anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of how space enhances our well-being. Aural architecture is not the exclusive domain of specialists. Accidentally or intentionally, we all function as aural architects., Formerly CIP.},

	abstract = {Companies are used to bringing in customers to participate in focus groups, usability laboratories, and market research surveys in order to help in the development of new products and services. And for improving products that customers know well, those tools are highly sophisticated. For example, knowledgeable customers are adept at identifying the specific scent of leather they expect in a luxury vehicle or at helping to tune the sound of a motorcycle engine to just the timbre that evokes feelings of power. But to go beyond improvements to the familiar, companies need to identify and meet needs that customers may not yet recognize. To accomplish that task, a set of techniques called empathic design can help. Rather than bring the customers to the company, empathic design calls for company representatives to watch customers using products and services in the context of their own environments. By doing so, managers can often identify unexpected uses for their products, just as the product manager of a cooking oil did when he observed a neighbor spraying the oil on the blades of a lawn mower to reduce grass buildup. They can also uncover problems that customers don't mention in surveys, as the president of Nissan Design did when he watched a couple struggling to remove the backseat of a competitor's minivan in order to transport a couch. The five-step process Dorothy Leonard and Jeffrey Rayport describe in detail is a relatively low-cost, low-risk way to identify customer needs, and it has the potential to redirect a company's existing technological capabilities toward entirely new businesses.},

But is it possible for spatial elements to be as important carriers of musical structure as the other aspects of sound? For a parameter to serve the requirements of musical development, it is necessary for that parameter to cover a range of perceptually different states. For ‘space’ to be more than a setting within which the main active elements in the structure unfold, it needs to satisfy these requirements. This paper explains a number of important spatial composition strategies available to the acousmatic composer in light of current technology and sound reproduction situations. The analysis takes an aesthetical rather than a technical standpoint.},

	abstract = {The congeries of theoretical views collectively referred to as “situated action” (SA) claim that humans and their interactions with the world cannot be understood using symbol‐system models and methodology, but only by observing them within real‐world contexts or building nonsymbolic models of them. SA claims also that rapid, real‐time interaction with a dynamically changing environment is not amenable to symbolic interpretation of the sort espoused by the cognitive science of recent decades. Planning and representation, central to symbolic theories, are claimed to be irrelevant in everyday human activity.
            We will contest these claims, as well as their proponents' characterizations of the symbol‐system viewpoint. We will show that a number of existing symbolic systems perform well in temporally demanding tasks embedded in complex environments, whereas the systems usually regarded as exemplifying SA are thoroughly symbolic (and representational), and, to the extent that they are limited in these respects, have doubtful prospects for extension to complex tasks. As our title suggests, we propose that the goals set forth by the proponents of SA can be attained only within the framework of symbolic systems. The main body of empirical evidence supporting our view resides in the numerous symbol systems constructed in the past 35 years that have successfully simulated broad areas of human cognition.},

However, few reports go into detail about how self and others mutually shape the design process and how to incorporate external evaluation into these designs. We describe a one-year process involving the design and evaluation of a prototype combining haptics and storytelling, aiming to materialise and share somatic memories of earthquakes experienced by a designer and her partner. We contribute with three strategies for bringing others into our autobiographical processes, avoiding the dilution of first-person voices while critically addressing design flaws that might hinder the representation of our stories.},

	abstract = {Wide-area soil moisture sensing is a key element for smart irrigation systems. However, existing soil moisture sensing methods usually fail to achieve both satisfactory mobility and high moisture estimation accuracy. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel soil moisture sensing system, named as SoilId, that combines a UAV and a COTS IR-UWB radar for wide-area soil moisture sensing without the need of burying any battery-powered in-ground device. Specifically, we design a series of novel methods to help SoilId extract soil moisture related features from the received radar signals, and automatically detect and discard the data contaminated by the UAV's uncontrollable motion and the multipath interference. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful representation ability of deep neural networks and carefully design a neural network model to accurately map the extracted radar signal features to soil moisture estimations. We have extensively evaluated SoilId against a variety of real-world factors, including the UAV's uncontrollable motion, the multipath interference, soil surface coverages, and many others. Specifically, the experimental results carried out by our UAV-based system validate that SoilId can push the accuracy limits of RF-based soil moisture sensing techniques to a 50\% quantile MAE of 0.23\%.},

In this paper, we explore version control in the creative domain of live coding music, a generative performance practice where programmers edit and run code live to generate audiovisual artifacts. To that end, we developed SHARP, a lightweight version control system that live coders can use during performances as well as in preparation or practice sessions. We conducted a user study where live coders used SHARP for several weeks, wrote diary entries reflecting on their sessions, recorded a performance using SHARP, and participated in exit interviews. We found that SHARP enabled participants to engage with musical form on the fly in novel ways. In addition, the study revealed multifaceted perspectives on how and when versioning can be useful in the context of live coding. Our results inform the design of versioning systems for live coding and more generally for performance and generative arts practices.},

Negative unintended consequences abound including the perpetuation and exacerbation of societal inequalities and divisions via algorithmic decision making. We present six grand challenges for the scientific community to create AI technologies that are humancentered, that is, ethical, fair, and enhance the human condition. These grand challenges are the result of an international collaboration across academia, industry and government and represent the consensus views of a group of 26 experts in the field of human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). In essence, these challenges advocate for a human-centered approach to AI that (1) is centered in human wellbeing, (2) is designed responsibly, (3) respects privacy, (4) follows human-centered design principles, (5) is subject to appropriate governance and oversight, and (6) interacts with individuals while respecting human’s cognitive capacities. We hope that these challenges and their associated research directions serve as a call for action to conduct research and development in AI that serves as a force multiplier towards more fair, equitable and sustainable societies.},

	abstract = {Non-verbal cues tone our communication. Previous studies found that non-verbal factors, such as spatial distance and gaze direction, significantly impact interpersonal communication. However, little is known about the behind multi-brain neural correlates and whether it could affect high-level creative group communication. Here, we provided a new, scalable, and neuro-based approach to explore the effects of non-verbal factors on different communication tasks, and revealed the underlying multi-brain neural correlates using fNIRS-based hyperscanning technique. Across two experiments, we found that closer spatial distance and more direct gaze angle could promote collaborative behaviors, improve both creative and non-creative communication outcomes, and enhance inter-brain neural synchronization. Moreover, compared to the non-creative communication task, participants’ inter-brain network was more intertwined when performing the creative communication task. These findings suggest that close spatial distance and direct gaze serve as positive social cues, bringing interacting brains into alignment and optimizing inter-brain information transfer, thus improving communication outcomes.
This study explores the turn-taking system in conversations involving speakers of Indonesian, focusing on explicit next speaker selection in Indonesian multiparty conversation. The dataset comes from nine and a half hours of recordings of everyday conversations between 64 people. Using conversation analysis, this study examines Indonesian speakers use of an explicit practice for next speaker selection – address terms – in questions. Specifically, it focuses on 238 questions including address terms. This study demonstrates that address terms are used to commence courses of action and deal with problems of mutual orientation, deal with problems that emerge in a turn or sequence, address a person-specific action, or carry out fine aspects of action formation. These findings offer a dimension for describing diversity and commonality in conversation across languages and cultures.
To define and operationalize three taught strategies for providing information in interactions with patients using videos collected in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
This was a qualitative exploratory study embedded in a randomized controlled design, using microanalysis of face-to-face dialogue as an inductive video analysis method to operationalize physicians’ use of three information-provision strategies. Data were 34 video-recorded simulated (but unscripted) interactions between 17 physicians and 34 multiple sclerosis patients collected before and after a brief course on information provision. We operationalized (1) mapping the patient’s preferences and (2) checking the patient’s understanding, and pauses indicative of (3) portioning information.
Results are detailed analytical definitions, criteria, and assessable, quantifiable outcomes for each of the three strategies. Patients responded to portioning pauses as expected: whereas 91\% of these pauses elicited an immediate patient response, only 23\% of non-portioning pauses did so.
Our methods revealed how to define and evaluate information sharing strategies physicians used within the contingencies of clinical interaction.
Findings provide applicable methods to teach, analyze, and evaluate information sharing strategies and indications for further training.
In this paper, we draw on German dyadic face-to-face conversations among friends in order to examine the interactional functions of gaze in reenactments, i.e. “re-presentations or depictions” (Sidnell, 2006: 377) of previously experienced or imagined events. Firstly, we show that reenactors use several different gaze patterns depending on whether the depicted original event is dialogic or non-dialogic. Secondly, we compare the use of different resources for initiating reenactments and switching roles during reenactments with regard to the interactional function of the different alternatives. Specifically, we describe a multimodal practice for switching characters during reenactments that are designed to invite laughter. In sum, the findings add to our knowledge about the various communicative functions of gaze in social interaction.},

	abstract = {Historically, the social aspects of language use have been considered the domain of social psychology, while the underlying psycholinguistic mechanisms have been the purview of cognitive psychology. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that these two dimensions are highly interrelated: cognitive mechanisms underlying speech production and comprehension interact with social psychological factors, such as beliefs about one's interlocutors and politeness norms, and with the dynamics of the conversation itself, to produce shared meaning. This realization has led to an exciting body of research integrating the social and cognitive dimensions which has greatly increased our understanding of human language use.  Each chapter in this volume demonstrates how the theoretical approaches and research methods of social and cognitive psychology can be successfully interwoven to provide insight into one or more fundamental questions about the process of interpersonal communication. The topics under investigation include the nature and role of speaker intentions in the communicative process, the production and comprehension of indirect speech and figurative language, perspective-taking and conversational collaboration, and the relationships between language, cognition, culture, and social interaction. The book will be of interest to all those who study interpersonal language use: social and cognitive psychologists, theoretical and applied linguists, and communication researchers.},

Realising this requires a step-change in digital music technologies. Going beyond today's digital sound files, future experiences will demand far richer musical information, whereby music content will be packaged in a flexible, structured way that combines audio recordings with rich, layered metadata to support interactive and adaptive musical experiences. This defines the overall ambition of FAST-to lay the foundations for a new generation of `semantic audio' technologies that underpin diverse future music experiences. This paper therefore aims to describe the overall vision of the project, set out the broad landscape in which it is working, highlight some key results and show how they bring out a central notion of FAST, that of Digital Music Objects, which are flexible constructs consisting of recorded music essence coupled with rich, semantic, linked metadata.},

Our analysis suggests that gesture is used to understand, communicate and form action through a process of shaping sounds in space. This metaphor highlights how aesthetic assessments are collaboratively produced and developed through coordinated spatial activity.

In doing so, we also highlight domains and applications driving the research field and discuss the ways in which explanations are given to the user.

To address it, many efforts have been made on training sophisticated models with few labeled data in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion. In this paper, we will review the recent progresses on these two major categories of methods. A wide spectrum of models will be categorized in a big picture, where we will show how they interplay with each other to motivate explorations of new ideas. We will review the principles of learning the transformation equivariant, disentangled, self-supervised and semi-supervised representations, all of which underpin the foundation of recent progresses. Many implementations of unsupervised and semi-supervised generative models have been developed on the basis of these criteria, greatly expanding the territory of existing autoencoders, generative adversarial nets (GANs) and other deep networks by exploring the distribution of unlabeled data for more powerful representations. We will discuss emerging topics by revealing the intrinsic connections between unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, and propose in future directions to bridge the algorithmic and theoretical gap between transformation equivariance for unsupervised learning and supervised invariance for supervised learning, and unify unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning. We will also provide a broader outlook of future directions to unify transformation and instance equivariances for representation learning, connect unsupervised and semi-supervised augmentations, and explore the role of the self-supervised regularization for many learning problems.},

The proposed approach allows a choreographer to story board a dance using stick figure sketches of a dancer. Inspired by traditional choreography, a set of simple annotations is introduced for ballet. These annotations help to retrieve and blend ballet 'mini-motions' in order to create a synthesized dance. To build the mini-motions, we have analyzed and processed several ballet movements available in a MoCap database.},

	abstract = {Unorthodox performance sites offer the opportunity to provide unique creative input into music composition and performances. Rather than resist the acoustic and design features of performance spaces, these features can become part of compositions and their performance making them site specific. Is it then possible to successfully integrate the acoustic characteristics of a specific performance site into the early compositional process, and can the performance site be just as integral to the ensemble as musicians are considered to be? Composing music this way proposes a very different creative process to what composers generally follow when creating music for traditional performance sites. This paper will review four musical works that explore site-specificity and the performance site as integral to the compositional process. It will also examine the way these works are linked to their particular performance site through a scale of specificity developed by British academic Fiona Wilkie.},

When considering semantic representation, four fundamental questions to ask are: How are word meanings related to conceptual structures? How is the meaning of each word represented? How are the meanings of different words related to one another? Can the same principles of organisation hold in different content domains? The article also discusses holistic theories of semantic representation, along with featural theories.},

Yet, today's solutions are unable to deliver robust and high tracking accuracies across multiple agents in practical, everyday environments - a feature central to the future of immersive and collaborative applications. This can be attributed to the limited scope of diversity leveraged by these fusion solutions, preventing them from catering to the multiple dimensions of accuracy, robustness (diverse environmental conditions) and scalability (multiple agents) simultaneously.
            In this work, we take an important step towards this goal by introducing the notion of dual-layer diversity to the problem of sensor fusion in multi-agent tracking. We demonstrate that the fusion of complementary tracking modalities, - passive/relative (e.g. visual odometry) and active/absolute tracking (e.g.infrastructure-assisted RF localization) offer a key first layer of diversity that brings scalability while the second layer of diversity lies in the methodology of fusion, where we bring together the complementary strengths of algorithmic (for robustness) and data-driven (for accuracy) approaches. ROVAR is an embodiment of such a dual-layer diversity approach that intelligently attends to cross-modal information using algorithmic and data-driven techniques that jointly share the burden of accurately tracking multiple agents in the wild. Extensive evaluations reveal ROVAR'S multi-dimensional benefits in terms of tracking accuracy, scalability and robustness to enable practical multi-agent immersive applications in everyday environments.},

This work expands the concept of organic architecture to the realm of the digital medium. Inspired by nature, analogies from physical phenomena and scientific principles are used to inform the research-creation. In doing so, glitch experiments in digital files enable a cocreativity with technology which reveal their underlying structures and thereby produce a spectrum of expression.

	abstract = {In self-supervised learning, a system is tasked with achieving a surrogate objective by defining alternative targets on a set of unlabeled data. The aim is to build useful representations that can be used in downstream tasks, without costly manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised formulation of relational reasoning that allows a learner to bootstrap a signal from information implicit in unlabeled data. Training a relation head to discriminate how entities relate to themselves (intra-reasoning) and other entities (inter-reasoning), results in rich and descriptive representations in the underlying neural network backbone, which can be used in downstream tasks such as classification and image retrieval. We evaluate the proposed method following a rigorous experimental procedure, using standard datasets, protocols, and backbones.

Drawing on postcolonial theory and critical musicology, the article looks at the means by which turntablists such as DJs Qbert and Kuttin Kandi confront internal forms of American cultural imperialism. More than ornamental fixtures for mainstream rap artists, turntablists are soloists with a range of specialized techniques through which they combine recordings into new works (mixing, beat-juggling) and pull expansive timbral sequences from the vinyl (scratching). These processes enable a broad spectrum of sounds and references, opening the door for turntablists to play with memory and with imperial narratives of progress. In performance, turntablists blur external racial definitions while paradoxically reinforcing subnational communities. In addition, because they appropriate commercial recordings and use primarily independent means of production and distribution, turntablists subvert a market powered by a handful of multinational companies.},

We will present a few examples that anticipate or expand the use of sonification as analytical tool to propose aesthetic approaches, accessing more complex layers of meaning in interactive design. By proposing topological, semantic, and technical perspectives, we  demonstrate the functional aspects of the multimedia artwork “The Only Object They Could Retrieve From Earth’s Lost Civilisation” (“The Only Object” from now on).

	abstract = {The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, commonly known as the 808, is a drum machine manufactured by  Roland Corporation between 1980 and 1983. It was one of the first drum machines to allow users to program rhythms instead of using preset patterns. Unlike its nearest competitor at the time, the more expensive Linn LM-1, the 808 generates sounds using analog synthesis rather than by playing samples (prerecorded sounds).
Launched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream, the 808 was a commercial failure. After building approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock. It was succeeded by the TR-909 in 1983.
Over the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market, ease of use and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, booming bass drum. It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, dance, and hip hop genres, popularized by early hits such as "Planet Rock" by Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force and "Sexual Healing" by Marvin Gaye.
The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine. Its popularity in hip hop has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the Fender Stratocaster's impact on rock. Its sounds are included with music software and modern drum machines and it has inspired unlicensed recreations.},

This late-breaking work presents an ongoing industrial research project aimed at designing, building, and implementing an XAI system for humanitarian aid planning. We draw on empirical data from our project and define current and future scenarios of use, adopting a scenario-based XAI design approach. These scenarios surface three central themes which shape human-AI collaboration in humanitarian aid planning: (1) Surfacing Causality, (2) Multifaceted Trust \& Lack of Data Quality, (3) Balancing Risky Situations. We explore each theme and in doing so, further our understanding of how humanitarian aid planners can partner with AI systems to better support forcibly displaced peoples.},

How do signals of understanding and misunderstanding affect the coordination of language use in conversation? Using a chat tool and a maze-based reference task, we test two experimental manipulations that selectively interfere with feedback in live conversation: (a) “Attenuation” that replaces positive signals of understanding such as “right” or “okay” with weaker, more provisional signals such as “errr” or “umm” and (2) “Amplification” that replaces relatively specific signals of misunderstanding from clarification requests such as “on the left?” with generic signals of trouble such as “huh?” or “eh?”. The results show that Amplification promotes rapid convergence on more systematic, abstract ways of describing maze locations while Attenuation has no significant effect. We interpret this as evidence that “running repairs”—the processes of dealing with misunderstandings on the fly—are key drivers of semantic coordination in dialogue. This suggests a new direction for experimental work on conversation and a productive way to connect the empirical accounts of Conversation Analysis with the representational and processing concerns of Formal Semantics and Psycholinguistics.},

Some features that we designers usually categorise as infrastructure problems may, to users, be useful interactional features. Examples include the edges and gaps in 802.11 coverage, and the patterns of where one can and cannot get GPS positioning. Sometimes we cannot smooth over or hide these ‘seams’. Seamfulness is about taking account of these reminders of the finite and physical nature of digital media. Seamful design involves deliberately revealing seams to users, and taking advantage of features usually considered as negative or problematic. We outline the origins of the seamful approach, offer two examples of seamful design, and finally discuss potential approaches to ‘design for appropriation’ whereby user activity drives infrastructural adaptation.},

Our method considers not only individual features but also their interactions, for a more detailed interpretation of the decisions made by networks. The algorithm is based on the factorization machine, a prediction method that calculates factor vectors for each feature. We conducted experiments on multiple datasets with different models to validate our method, achieving higher performance than the previous work. We show that including interactions not only generates explanations but also makes them richer and is able to convey more information. We show examples of produced explanations in a simple visual format and verify that they are easily interpretable and plausible.},

Recently, Deep Neural Network (DNN) is achieving a profound result over the standard neural network for classification and recognition problems. It is a hot machine learning area proven both useful and innovative. This paper has thoroughly reviewed various rule extraction algorithms, considering the classification scheme: decompositional, pedagogical, and eclectics. It also presents the evaluation of these algorithms based on the neural network structure with which the algorithm is intended to work. The main contribution of this review is to show that there is a limited study of rule extraction algorithm from DNN.},

	abstract = {Creating an artificially intelligent (AI) aid for music composers requires a practical and modular approach, one that allows the composer to manipulate the technology when needed in the search for new sounds. Many existing approaches fail to capture the interest of composers as they are limited beyond their demonstrative purposes, allow for only minimal interaction from the composer or require GPU access to generate samples quickly. This paper introduces Score-Transformer (ST), a practical integration of deep learning technology to aid in the creation of new music which works seamlessly alongside any popular software notation (Finale, Sibelius, etc.). Score-Transformer is built upon a variant of the powerful transformer model, currently used in state-of-the-art natural language models. Owing to hierarchical and sequential similarities between music and language, the transformer model can learn to write polyphonic MIDI music based on any styles, genres, or composers it is trained upon. This paper briefly outlines how the model learns and later notates music based upon any prompt given to it from the user. Furthermore, ST can be updated at any time on additional MIDI recordings minimizing the risk of the software becoming outdated or impractical for continued use.},

The practice of sampling involves taking pieces of music or found sounds and integrating them into a new composition which might be partly or even completely composed of this material. Although sampling goes back to at least the period after World War II when the technique was used by Pierre Schaeffer and others in the musique concrète movemen,t it is these days most commonly linked to hip-hop. Hip-hop originated as an African American popular music form and sampling is sometimes understood to be an expression of African American cultural aesthetics. In this article I argue that sampling has a lengthy Jewish American history. I trace it back to “Yes! We Have No Bananas,” first recorded in 1923. I argue that there is a strong Jewish input to hip-hop sampling that includes artists like Steinski, the Beastie Boys, and Beck. Further, the work of these artists is often considered innovative in hip-hop. I argue that this is because Jewish sampling is founded on a Jewish worldview in which catastrophe generates fragments which are synthesized together to (re)form culture. In terms of sampling, fragments equate to samples.},

A secondary analysis of the 2009 Global status report on road safety: time for action survey was undertaken to evaluate legislation on five risk factors (speed management, drinking and driving, motorcycle helmet use, seatbelt use, and use of child restraints) in the Americas. Laws were classified depending on their level of progression: the existence of legislation, whether the legislation is adequate, a level of law enforcement {\textgreater} 6 (on a scale of 0-10), and whether the law is considered comprehensive. A descriptive analysis was performed. The totality of the countries has national or subnational legislation for at least one of the five risk factors. However, 63\% have laws on the five risk factors studied, and none of them has comprehensive laws for all five. Seatbelt use appears to be the most extended enforced legislation, while speeding laws appear to be the least enforced. There are positive efforts that should be recognized in the region. However, the region stands in different stages of progression. Law enforcement remains the main issue to be tackled. Laws should be based on evidence about what is already known to be effective.},

	abstract = {Heir to the racist configuration of the American art exchange and the delimiting appraisals of blackness in the American mainstream media, Jean-Michel Basquiat appeared on the late 1970s New York City street art scene — then he called himself "SAMO." Not long thereafter, Basquiat grew into one of the most influential artists of an international movement that began around 1980, marked by a return to figurative painting. Given its rough, seemingly untrained and extreme, conceptual nature, Basquiat's high-art oeuvre might not look so sophisticated to the uninformed viewer. However, Basquiat's work reveals a powerful poetic and visual gift, "heady enough to confound academics and hip enough to capture the attention span of the hip hop nation," as Greg Tate has remarked. As noted by Richard Marshall, Basquiat's aesthetic strength actually comes from his striving "to achieve a balance between the visual and intellectual attributes" of his artwork. Like Marshall, Tate, and others, I will connect with Basquiat's unique, self-reflexively experimental visual practices of signifying and examine anew Basquiat's active contribution to his self-alienation, as Hebdige has called it. Basquiat's aesthetic makes of his paintings economies of accumulation, building a productive play of contingency from the mainstream's constructions of race. This aesthetic move speaks to a need for escape from the perceived epistemic necessities of blackness. Through these economies of accumulation we see, as Tate has pointed out, Basquiat's "intellectual obsession" with issues such as ancestry/modernity, personhood/property and originality/origins of knowledge, driven by his tireless need to problematize mainstream media's discourses surrounding race — in other words, a commodified American Africanism.},

Ptolemy's treatise seeks to invest it with new scientific rigour; its consistently sophisticated procedural self-awareness marks it as a key text in the history of science. This book is a sustained methodological exploration of Ptolemy's project. After an analysis of his explicit pronouncements on the science's aims and the methods appropriate to it, it examines Ptolemy's conduct of his investigation in detail, concluding that despite occasional uncertainties, the declared procedure is followed with remarkable fidelity. Ptolemy pursues tenaciously his novel objective of integrating closely the project's theoretical and empirical phases and shows astonishing mastery of the concept, the design and the conduct of controlled experimental tests. By opening up this neglected text to historians of science, the book aims to provide a point of departure for wider studies of Greek scientific method},

	url = {https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/975544/},
	abstract = {Selected Sounds involves an ethnographic investigation into the sampling and mixing practices of a group of sound artists from Montreal, Canada. Seven composers (in one case, a composing duo) each contributed a single piece of digitized sound to the project. Each was free to submit any sound they liked, with the one requirement that all samples be selected from sources discovered around Montreal. After collecting the audio files, I placed them together on a CD, copies of which were distributed to every participant. Each composer then put together a track drawing on this sample-pool exclusively for source material. The resulting mixes have been compiled into a nationally distributed, independent audio-CD. All were interviewed regarding the evolution of their knowledge of digital audio production methods, as well as their thoughts on audio sampling.  In Chapter 1 (the Introduction) I present the research project and outline the theoretical framework as well as challenges addressed. In Chapter 2, I discuss various methodological choices made in Selected Sounds as a reflexive ethnography that invokes sample-based musical practices of citation, friendship and creative production as mechanisms for highly-engaged research in the arts, humanities and social sciences. Chapter 3 presents a literature review of recent academic accounts of audio sampling and the impacts of digital technology upon the contemporary reception and use of media. Chapter 4 introduces Appendix A-an interactive database developed from out of the Selected Sounds interview process. Chapter 5 concludes by taking up conversations contained in Appendix A and organizing them around seven different reconfigurations of the concept "sampling" for 2007: sampling-as-technology, sampling-as-community, samplingas-memory, sampling-as-collecting, sampling-as-ethics, and sampling-as-recording.  Appendix A is the Selected Sounds interview database.  Appendix B contains a brief introduction to "The Lesbians on Ecstasy," a musical performing group of which three of the participants in Selected Sounds are members.  Appendix C is a transcript of the final meeting with the Selected Sounds research group},

	abstract = {Radio-Frequency (RF) based human activity recognition (HAR) enables many attractive applications such as smart home, health monitoring, and virtual reality (VR). Among multiple RF sensors, mmWave radar is emerging as a new trend due to its fine-grained sensing capability. However, laborious data collection and labeling processes are required when employing a radar-based sensing system in a new environment. To this end, we propose RF-CM, a general cross-modal human activity recognition framework. The key enabler is to leverage the knowledge learned from a massive WiFi dataset to build a radar-based HAR system with limited radar samples. It can significantly reduce the overhead of training data collection. In addition, RF-CM can work well regardless of the deployment setups of WiFi and mmWave radar, such as performing environments, users' characteristics, and device deployment. RF-CM achieves this by first capturing the activity-related variation patterns through data processing schemes. It then employs a convolution neural network-based feature extraction module to extract the high-dimensional features to be fed into the activity recognition module. Finally, RF-CM takes the generalization knowledge from WiFi networks as guide labels to supervise the training of the radar model, thus enabling a few-shot radar-based HAR system. We evaluate RF-CM by applying it to two HAR applications, fine-grained American sign language recognition (WiFi-cross-radar) and coarse-grained gesture recognition (WiFi-cross-RFID). The accuracy improvement of over 10\% in both applications demonstrates the effectiveness of RF-CM. This cross-modal ability allows RF-CM to support more cross-modal applications.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The paper seeks to make a substantial contribution to the still controversial question of design foundations. Design/methodology/approach – A generic hypercyclic design process model is derived from basic notions of evolution and learning in different domains of knowing (and turns out to be not very different from existing ones). The second‐order cybernetics and evolutionary thinking provide theoretical support. Findings – The paper presents a model of designerly knowledge production, which has the potential to serve as a genuine design research paradigm. It does not abandon the scientific or the hermeneutic or the arts \& crafts paradigm but concludes that they have to be embedded into a design paradigm. “Design paradigm” means that “objects” are not essential, but are created in communication and language. Research limitations/implications – Foundations cannot be found in the axiomatic statements of the formal sciences, nor in the empirical approaches of the natural sciences, nor in the hermeneutic techniques of the humanities. Designing explores and creates the new; it deals with the fit of artefacts and their human, social and natural contexts. Therefore foundations for design (if they exist at all) have to be based on the generative character of designing, which can be seen as the very activity which made and still makes primates into humans. Practical implications – The hypercyclic model provides a cybernetic foundation (or rather substantiation) for design, which – at the same time – serves as a framework for design and design research practice. As long as the dynamic model is in action, i.e. stabilized in communication, it provides foundations; once it stops, they dissolve. The fluid circular phenomena of discourse and communication provide the only “eternal” essence of design. Originality/value – “Design objects” as well as “theory objects” are transient materializations or eigenvalues in these circular processes. Designing objects and designing theories are equivalent. “Problems” and “solutions” as well as “foundations” are objects of this kind. This contributes to a conceptual integration of the acting and reflecting disciplines.},

In doing so he shows how a non-linear conception of time and history balanced his famous rethinking of the question of space. This volume also includes his earlier essays on "The Rhythmanalysis Project" and "Attempt at the Rhythmanalysis of Mediterranean Towns."},

In this paper we discuss the use of a tool developed for the specific purpose of documenting design projects and prompting reflection about design events as part of doing research through design. Based on cases lasting from nine to thirteen months we address specific benefits and challenges that we have encountered while employing the tool. Challenges concern roles and responsibilities, lack of routines, determining what to document, and finding the right level of detail. Benefits include support of shared reflection and discussion in on-going projects, the development, refining, and reflection upon research questions, scaffolding longitudinal and cross-project studies. Moreover, the benefits derived from entering design materials and other kinds of artefacts into a tool may not be achieved until must later, for instance when writing research publications.},

This research has initially focused upon understanding the impacts that technological intervention has upon our day-to-day life and is leading us to explore the ways in which in-situ design, development and evaluation can be used to understand and explore these technological interventions. Is it the case that lab-based studies, taking people out of their natural environment and designing in the lab without long term user engagement are no longer appropriate to properly understand the impacts of technology in the real world?},

While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},

Compared to statistical modeling approaches, machine learning makes fewer explicit assumptions about data structures, such as linearity. Consequently, the parameters of machine learning models usually cannot be easily related to the data generating process. To learn about the modeled relationships, partial dependence (PD) plots and permutation feature importance (PFI) are often used as interpretation methods. However, PD and PFI lack a theory that relates them to the data generating process. We formalize PD and PFI as statistical estimators of ground truth estimands rooted in the data generating process. We show that PD and PFI estimates deviate from this ground truth not only due to statistical biases, but also due to learner variance and Monte Carlo approximation errors. To account for these uncertainties in PD and PFI estimation, we propose the learner-PD and the learner-PFI based on model refits and propose corrected variance and confidence interval estimators.},

An area that draws increasing attention is the automatic generation of music, with various applications including systems that support and inspire the process of music composition. For these assistive systems, in order to be successful and accepted by users, it is imperative to give the user agency and express their personal style in the process of composition. In this paper, we demonstrate ReStyle-MusicVAE, a system for human-AI co-creation in music composition. More specifically, ReStyle-MusicVAE combines the automatic melody generation and variation approach of MusicVAE and adds semantic control dimensions to further steer the process. To this end, expert-annotated melody lines created for music production are used to define stylistic anchors, which serve as semantic references for interpolation. We present an easy-to-use web app built on top of the Magenta.js JavaScript library and pre-trained MusicVAE checkpoints.},

The current generation of models is not at any level of simulated consciousness sufficient to trigger immediate ethical blocks, and stands open to systems surgery. Beyond morphing of inputs and outputs, hidden layers of deep learning models may themselves be actively stimulated and substituted, from unit weights and biases to activation functions. Layers from multiple networks may be swapped and interpolated, from single units to complete layers. The hybridity of musical formation takes place at the level of model internals, in artistic transformations beyond standard transfer learning. This activity of AI code bending is dubbed here ‘hybrainity’, and alongside theoretical discussion of its origins, potential and ethics, examples of hacking particular machine learning models for new creative projects are provided, including applications in live performance and audiovisual generation.},

Within the context of critical contemporary challenges posed by AI and big data, the value of interdisciplinary research collaboration as offering original research analysis with clear policy implications and outputs becomes apparent. CAIDG’s research approach strikes a balance between producing academically rigorous research built on clear theoretical foundations, aligned with creative method applications to meet the demands of emerging and nascent fields of academic scholarship (i.e., AI governance, law and technology, STS studies). This paper is built on a series of interviews – full transcripts are included – with the research population to capture their methodological experiences of integrating the wider interests of society into their academic research at CAIDG.},

	abstract = {Critical evaluations of audio mash‐ups and remixes tend to congregate around two poles. On the one hand, these often clever re‐combinations of recorded music are celebrated as innovative and creative interventions in the material of bland commodity culture. On the other hand, they are often reviled as derivative, inauthentic, and illegal because they do nothing more than appropriate and reconfigure the intellectual property of others. This essay does not side with either position but identifies and critiques the common understanding and fundamental assumptions that make these two, opposed positions possible in the first place. The investigation of this matter is divided into two main parts. The first considers the traditional understanding of technologically enabled reproduction and the often unquestioned value it invests in the concept of originality. It does so by beginning with a somewhat unlikely source, Plato's Phaedrus—a dialogue that, it is argued, articulates the original concept of originality that both determines and is reproduced in the theories and practices of sound recording. The second part of the essay demonstrates how the audio mash‐up deliberately intervenes in this tradition, advancing a fundamental challenge to the original understanding and privilege of originality. In making this argument, however, the essay does not endeavor to position the mash‐up as anything unique or innovative. Instead, it demonstrates how mash‐ups, true to their thoroughly derivative nature, plunder, reuse, and remix anomalies that are already available in and constitutive of recorded music.},

Plato of Athens, who laid the foundations ofthe Western philosophical tradition and in range and depthranks among its greatest practitioners, was born to a prosperous and politically active family ca. 427 bce. In early life an admirer of Socrates, Plato later founded thefirst institution of higher learning in the West, the Academy, among whose many notable alumni was Aristotle. Traditionally ascribed to Plato are thirty-six dialogues developing Socrates' dialectic method and composed with great stylistic virtuosity, together with thirteen letters. Republic, a masterpiece of philosophical and political thought, concerns righteousness both in individuals and in communities, and proposes an ideal state organized and governed on philosophical principles. This edition, which replaces the original Loeb edition by Paul Shorey, offers text, translation, and annotation thatare fully current with modern scholarship.

These systems cannot recognize activities that rely on verbal assessment, lack visual cues, or do not use medical devices. We examined speech-based activity and activity-stage recognition in a clinical domain, making the following contributions. (1) We collected a high-quality dataset representing common activities and activity stages during actual trauma resuscitation events-the initial evaluation and treatment of critically injured patients. (2) We introduced a novel multimodal network based on audio signal and a set of keywords that does not require a high-performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine. (3) We designed novel contextual modules to capture dynamic dependencies in team conversations about activities and stages during a complex workflow. (4) We introduced a data augmentation method, which simulates team communication by combining selected utterances and their audio clips, and showed that this method contributed to performance improvement in our data-limited scenario. In offline experiments, our proposed context-aware multimodal model achieved F1-scores of 73.2±0.8\% and 78.1±1.1\% for activity and activity-stage recognition, respectively. In online experiments, the performance declined about 10\% for both recognition types when using utterance-level segmentation of the ASR output. The performance declined about 15\% when we omitted the utterance-level segmentation. Our experiments showed the feasibility of speech-based activity and activity-stage recognition during dynamic clinical events.},

	abstract = {AI systems for high quality music generation typically rely on extremely large musical datasets to train the AI models. This creates barriers to generating music beyond the genres represented in dominant datasets such as Western Classical music or pop music. We undertook a 4 month international research project summarised in this paper to explore the eXplainable AI (XAI) challenges and opportunities associated with reducing barriers to using marginalised genres of music with AI models. XAI opportunities identified included topics of improving transparency and control of AI models, explaining the ethics and bias of AI models, fine tuning large models with small datasets to reduce bias, and explaining style-transfer opportunities with AI models. Participants in the research emphasised that whilst it is hard to work with small datasets such as marginalised music and AI, such approaches strengthen cultural representation of underrepresented cultures and contribute to addressing issues of bias of deep learning models. We are now building on this project to bring together a global International Responsible AI Music community and invite people to join our network.},

The CSI measures six dimensions of creativity support: Exploration, Expressiveness, Immersion, Enjoyment, Results Worth Effort, and Collaboration. The CSI allows researchers to understand not just how well a tool supports creative work overall, but what aspects of creativity support may need attention. In this article, we present the CSI, along with scenarios for how it can be deployed in a variety of HCI research settings and how the CSI scores can help target design improvements.

	abstract = {Much of the discourse surrounding sampling practice has been couched in an archaic rhetoric of originality and creativity, predicated on the reproductive mode of creation rather than the practices own creative logic. These notions have emerged from a metaphysics which privileges the origin as the centre of semantic production. However, this discursive preoccupation with the past is not entirely irrelevant in sampling practice. Rather, the historically inscribed aura of the original holds a redefined, but necessary, place in the practice. This essay examines the theoretical underpinnings of the discussion so far, then reconciling these with the specific culture of sample-based hip-hop production. Through close readings of some musical examples, it posits a theoretical framework for sampling practice which takes its unique properties into account. By mapping the trajectory of several samples from source to new incarnation, the sample is revealed as the space of simultaneous play and rupture, where the past both defines the present and is effaced by it. As such, sampling creates a tradition that involves the past without deferring to its structures and limitations, restoring a revised mode of agency to the practice.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The article’s contextual sections focus on briefly delineating this world of sonic creativity and placing it within today’s sampling culture as well as dealing with two political aspects of sampling, a musician’s attitude towards the reuse of sonic materials and the legality of sampled sounds, including musical passages, in the discussion of which current legislation related to sampling is challenged. Following this, a number of categories are presented in terms of the types of sampling material that is being used as well as how sample-based works are presented. The subsequent section is perhaps the most poignant in the article, namely the opening up of this form of innovative composition from a more traditional ‘artist creates work’ mode of operation to a more collaborative one which is essentially already part of most other forms of sampling culture. The objective here is to suggest that such collaborative approaches will enable sample-based sound-based music to become part of the lives of a much broader group than those currently involved with it.},

In the opera Sophocles: Antigone by one of the authors of this paper, random walks on neo- Riemannian PLR spaces were experimented with yielding mixed impressions of process music and post-romantic chromaticism. When the random walk is steered by transformational rules, special textures and harmonies emerge. We propose a new kind of parameterizable random walks, a generative system, on a space of arbitrary length chords equipped with an arbitrary distance measure steered from a customizable corpus learned by the system. The corpus provides a particular texture and harmony to the generative process. The learned neo-Riemannian spaces equipped with some distance measure provide the transformational rule base of the concatenative synthesis process.},

The system is based on a variational autoencoder neural network, uses a data structure that is capable of encoding rhythms in simple and compound meter, and can learn models from little training data. To facilitate the exploration of models, we implemented a visualizer that relies on the dynamic nature of the pulsing rhythmic patterns. To test our system in real-life musical practice, we collected small-scale datasets of contemporary music genre rhythms and trained models with them. We found that the non-linearities of the learned latent spaces coupled with tactile interfaces to interact with the models were very expressive and led to unexpected places in musical composition and live performance settings. A music album was recorded and it was premiered at a major music festival using the VAE latent space on stage.},

	abstract = {There is a current debate about if, and in what sense, machine learning systems used in the medical context need to be explainable. Those arguing in favor contend these systems require post hoc explanations for each individual decision to increase trust and ensure accurate diagnoses. Those arguing against suggest the high accuracy and reliability of the systems is sufficient for providing epistemic justified beliefs without the need for explaining each individual decision. But, as we show, both solutions have limitations—and it is unclear either address the epistemic worries of the medical professionals using these systems. We argue these systems do require an explanation, but an institutional explanation. These types of explanations provide the reasons why the medical professional should rely on the system in practice—that is, they focus on trying to address the epistemic concerns of those using the system in specific contexts and specific occasions. But ensuring that these institutional explanations are fit for purpose means ensuring the institutions designing and deploying these systems are transparent about the assumptions baked into the system. This requires coordination with experts and end-users concerning how it will function in the field, the metrics used to evaluate its accuracy, and the procedures for auditing the system to prevent biases and failures from going unaddressed. We contend this broader explanation is necessary for either post hoc explanations or accuracy scores to be epistemically meaningful to the medical professional, making it possible for them to rely on these systems as effective and useful tools in their practices.},

	abstract = {This article explores the notion of artistic collaboration between performer and composer, a topic that has attracted some attention but whose methodology might be thought to preclude objective discussion by the participants themselves. Although our report can make no claims to objectivity either, it attempts a critical reflection on a specific collaboration between the two authors as composer and performer, respectively. Cast in a dialogical format, it traces the genesis of a composition by Fabrice Fitch for speaking cellist, Per Serafino Calbarsi II: Le Songe de Panurge, written in 2002–3 and premiered in London in October 2006. The collaboration first evolved as a constant exchange of ideas in which concept, technique, and realization were held in fine balance. The piece engages a variety of frames of reference. If its stance in relation to the instrument clearly draws on certain contemporary traditions, for example Lachenmann’s musique concrète instrumentale, other aspects draw on earlier idioms, notably a specialized instance of scordatura, and the use of a spoken text (from the third book of Rabelais’s Pantagruel) that recalls Marin Marais’s Tableau de l’opération de la taille. The interferences and resonances between these influences pose aesthetic questions that are explored within the piece and its performance, while remaining open for the analyst and audience. Finally, the ‘extended techniques’ employed posed specific notational problems. The resulting score navigates a path between tablature and ‘traditional’ notation, in which the emphasis between what is heard and what is played shifts constantly. This hybrid status, we imagine, constitutes a challenge not only for the performer, but for the analyst as well.},

The volume further examines what it means that a quantifier can have multiple meanings, and addresses how existential vagueness can induce vagueness in our modal notions. Finally, the book explores the role played by quantifiers with respect to various kinds of semantic paradoxes, the logicality issue, ontological commitment, and the behavior of quantifiers in intensional contexts},

	abstract = {Reference is a relation that obtains between certain sorts of representational tokens (e.g., names, mental states, pictures)and objects. For instance, when I assert that “George W. Bush is a Republican,” I use a particular sort of representational token — i.e. the name‘George W. Bush’— to refer to a particular individual — namely, George W. Bush.  While names and other referentialterms are hardly the only type of representational token capable ofreferring, linguistic tokens like these have long stood at the center of philosophical inquiries into the nature of reference.  Accordingly,this entry will focus almost entirely on linguistic reference.  For more on the reference of mental states, see the entries oncausal theories of mental content, externalism about mental content, andteleological theories of mental content. For more on the reference of pictures,see the entry onGoodman's aesthetics., Proper names are standardly considered a paradigm example of linguisticreference — or, more specifically, a relation that obtains between certain sorts of linguistic expressions and what speakers use those expressions to talk about.  Other expressions which are generally consideredto be of the referring sort include indexicals like ‘I’, ‘here’, ‘now’, and ‘that’. While it is highlyquestionable that all words refer, most philosophers of language assumethat at least certain sorts of terms (e.g. proper names and indexicals) regularlyand reliably do so. It is these sorts of terms that will serve as our primaryfocus below. Assuming that at least certain sorts of terms do in fact refer, the central question regarding linguistic reference becomes: how do such terms refer? What, in other words, is the ‘mechanism’ of reference? Subsidiary questions concern the relation between reference and meaning, reference and truth, and referenceand knowledge. Some philosophers have thought that the nature of reference is able to shed light on important metaphysical or epistemological issues. Other philosophers, however, are less sanguine. Indeed, certain philosophers have gone so far asto deny that reference is a substantive relation, one deserving of serious philosophical scrutiny.},

However, as raw waveform modelling remains an inherently difficult task, audio generative models are either computationally intensive, rely on low sampling rates, are complicated to control or restrict the nature of possible signals. Among those models, Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) give control over the generation by exposing latent variables, although they usually suffer from low synthesis quality. In this paper, we introduce a Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder (RAVE) allowing both fast and high-quality audio waveform synthesis. We introduce a novel two-stage training procedure, namely representation learning and adversarial fine-tuning. We show that using a post-training analysis of the latent space allows a direct control between the reconstruction fidelity and the representation compactness. By leveraging a multi-band decomposition of the raw waveform, we show that our model is the first able to generate 48kHz audio signals, while simultaneously running 20 times faster than real-time on a standard laptop CPU. We evaluate synthesis quality using both quantitative and qualitative subjective experiments and show the superiority of our approach compared to existing models. Finally, we present applications of our model for timbre transfer and signal compression. All of our source code and audio examples are publicly available.},

We provide an in-depth review of recent advances in representation learning with a focus on autoencoder-based models. To organize these results we make use of meta-priors believed useful for downstream tasks, such as disentanglement and hierarchical organization of features. In particular, we uncover three main mechanisms to enforce such properties, namely (i) regularizing the (approximate or aggregate) posterior distribution, (ii) factorizing the encoding and decoding distribution, or (iii) introducing a structured prior distribution. While there are some promising results, implicit or explicit supervision remains a key enabler and all current methods use strong inductive biases and modeling assumptions. Finally, we provide an analysis of autoencoder-based representation learning through the lens of rate-distortion theory and identify a clear tradeoff between the amount of prior knowledge available about the downstream tasks, and how useful the representation is for this task.},

	shorttitle = {Reassembling the {Social}},
	abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'. Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social', as used by Social Scientists, has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stablilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. But Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'. Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling; and a type of material, distinct from others. Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a 'social explanations' of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion, and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages' of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society. This approach, a 'sociology of associations', has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

We derive five interference conditions for such art-based ML prototypes—situational whole, small data, shallow model, learnable algorithm, and somaesthetic behaviour—and describe their widening of design and engineering practices of ML prototyping. Finally, we sketch how a process of intra-active machine learning could complement that of interactive machine learning to take materiality as an entry point for ML design within HCI.},

The article will problematise the uncompromising modernist notion espoused by Babbitt of a ‘suitably equipped receptor’ (Babbitt 1958), and posit examples of well-known composers whose hearing markedly diverged from the otologically normal, an acoustics standard from which A-weighted decibels is predicated (ISO 226:2003). In conclusion the concept of auraldiverse hearing is proposed and creative strategies that eschew or problematise auraltypical archetypes in sonic arts practice and theory wherever they may lie are encouraged.},

The volume considers archive in a Derridean sense, as always in the process of being constructed such that the assessment of the African anticolonial archive is one that involves a contemporary process of curating. The essays in this volume, as well as the volume itself, enact different ways of curating material from this period.The project reflects an approach to documents, arguments, and materials that can be considered “international relations” and “world politics,” but in ways that that intentionally leaves them unhinged from these disciplinary meanings. While we examine many of the same questions that have been asked within area studies, African studies, and International Relations, we do so through an alternative archive. In doing so, we challenge the assumption that Africa is solely the domain of policy makers and area studies, and African peoples as the objects of data},

As the size of modern data sets grows, being able to present a domain specialist with a short list of “representative” samples chosen from the data set is of increasing interpretative value. While much recent statistical research has been focused on producing sparse-in-the-variables methods, this paper aims at achieving sparsity in the samples. We discuss a method for selecting prototypes in the classification setting (in which the samples fall into known discrete categories). Our method of focus is derived from three basic properties that we believe a good prototype set should satisfy. This intuition is translated into a set cover optimization problem, which we solve approximately using standard approaches. While prototype selection is usually viewed as purely a means toward building an efficient classifier, in this paper we emphasize the inherent value of having a set of prototypical elements. That said, by using the nearest-neighbor rule on the set of prototypes, we can of course discuss our method as a classifier as well. We demonstrate the interpretative value of producing prototypes on the well-known USPS ZIP code digits data set and show that as a classifier it performs reasonably well. We apply the method to a proteomics data set in which the samples are strings and therefore not naturally embedded in a vector space. Our method is compatible with any dissimilarity measure, making it amenable to situations in which using a non-Euclidean metric is desirable or even necessary.},

Extracurricular activity is one site where students might be able to develop these additional capacities towards their future imagined selves. Our case study, based on in-depth interviews with 61 students, found different orientations towards the future, with only some displaying future selves attuned to employability. Other students were more firmly orientated to the present and developing student identities or unable to elaborate or act on imaged futures because of the contingencies of the present. We conclude that paying attention to differing temporalities and to the insights derived from the possible selves literature are likely to be fruitful for further research on extracurricular activity.},

This collection has been studied in depth to tell the international story of photographic modernism not only through historical fact and provenance, but also through materiality, technique, and circulation. This exhibition, drawn entirely from the MoMA Library collection, explores the circulation of avant-garde photographs as reproductions in influential illustrated magazines, exhibition catalogues, and books in the first half of the 20th century, and how the dissemination of photography through printed materials was a crucial means through which modernist photographers formed an international network.},

The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259855
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.
RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).
CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6223/1259855/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.
The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.
Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.

	title = {Protagorean {Epistemology} and {Dialectic}},
	abstract = {Contemporary dispute among teachers of rhetoric between those who prefer the classical tradition of rhetoric and those who champion an epistemic view of rhetoric has antecedents among the disputes of the ancient Greek scholars. Some of the vital themes of epistemology can be traced back to Protagoras of Abdera, one of the two great leaders of the Sophistic movement and a pioneer of epistemic rhetoric. Comparatively little contemporary attention has been paid to his work, and there are only four or five sentences that can with any confidence be attributed to his authorship. Other evidence of Protagoras' views must be sought in the works of Diogenes Laertius, Sextus Empiricus, and Plato. While Parmenides rejected all assertions of not-being, and Socrates and Plato objectified being in a world of "ideal forms," Protagoras and his fellow Sophist Gorgius of Leontini took an opposing view. Gorgius identified flaws in Parmenidean logic and went on to demonstrate that nothing absolutely "is." In Plato's dialogue "Theaetetus," Protagoras calls upon Socrates to look beyond the surface of Protagoras' assertion that man is the measure of all things to the logos of the statement. This call to anti-logic was a particularly Protagorean approach to dialectic. A coherent dialectical method emerges from Protagorean epistemology: (1) that there are at least two opposed "logoi" in everything; (2) that it is the function and excellence of discourse to bring both out; and (3) that it can be demonstrated that there is no contradiction between the two.

The instrument was modified to provide for storage oscilloscope displays. Amplitude in the spectrographic displays was represented as above or below a given threshold. The eight subjects were of normal intelligence and severely or profoundly deaf. They ranged in age from three to twenty years. The following features of speech were modified successfully in the school-age or adult subjects: 1) abnormally high pitch, 2) incorrect timing, 3) excessive nasalization, 4) faults of segmental structure. The amplitude contour display was used to encourage spontaneous vocalization in pre-school and school-age subjects; segmental features appearing in this vocalization were practiced consciously and, where possible, with linguistic reference. Intelligibility improved in the school-age subjects and some carry-over into everyday speech was observed. Plans have been made for building another translator incorporating an extended filter bank with filter widths and center frequencies appropriate to the spectrographic and pitch-contour display of children's speech. A tentative program of instruction of deaf school-age children has been drawn up. Further preliminary work with pre-school deaf children is planned.},

Is there a tacit preselected audiometric norm or even a pair of golden ears, at its core? The article will problematise the uncompromising modernist notion espoused by Babbitt of a ‘suitably equipped receptor’ (Babbitt 1958), and posit examples of well-known composers whose hearing markedly diverged from the otologically normal, an acoustics standard from which A-weighted decibels is predicated (ISO 226:2003). In conclusion the concept of auraldiverse hearing is proposed and creative strategies that eschew or problematise auraltypical archetypes in sonic arts practice and theory wherever they may lie are encouraged.},

Using a mixed-methods approach, we combined insights using the Observable Creative Sensemaking (OCSM) method with data from structured interviews. The study involved 20 participants engaging in a collaborative drawing task under each interaction scenario. Key findings reveal an average OCSM curve indicative of typical human-human interactions, varied themes in human-AI collaboration, and a notable influence of AI embodiment on participant perceptions, with the robot interface resembling human-human collaboration more closely than the software interface. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into how different interaction modalities influence the perceived role of AI in the co-creative process and provides design considerations for enhancing human-AI co-creative interactions.},

However, little is known about users’ participation and their division of labor in these audits, which are essential to support these collective efforts in the future. Through collecting and analyzing 17,984 tweets from four recent cases of user-driven audits, we shed light on patterns of users’ participation and engagement, especially with the top contributors in each case. We also identified the various roles users’ generated content played in these audits, including hypothesizing, data collection, amplification, contextualization, and escalation.

	abstract = {override is a series of two experimental works for mobile phone investigating creative ways in which the experience of audio-visual relationships may be interrupted to facilitate a more considered encounter with the senses. The aim of this project was to gain a more visceral understanding of how sound might function in combination with vision, and how sensing and sense-making might relate to each other. In other words, I was exploring an embodied understanding of Chion’s (1994) notion of synchresis. Somewhat led by Niall Moody’s (2009) thesis that the motion inherent in sight and sound acts as a connecting device between them, I set out to create an environment in which the congruity between the senses would be interrupted.

override developed into two audio-visual works to be experienced on a double-decker bus with the help of a mobile phone and noise-cancelling headphones. Both pieces aim to create discrepancy between seeing and hearing with the help of the movement felt whilst riding on a bus. In both cases the visual aspect of the film shows a journey made on a similar bus, whilst the sonic aspects and their relationship to the visual and kinetic information differ.

This article will begin by providing a project outline of override, as an experience of making at the intersections of hearing, seeing and kinetic sensations. It then discusses several topics relevant to its making: the relationships between synchresis and motion, virtual and real experiences, the role of listening in the development of the project and the journey from sensing to sense-making, explored from the perspective of creating override. One key point that emerged from this project was the realisation that conceptualisations – including preconceptions – readily insert themselves into sensorial experiences. Attempting to interrupt sensorial congruity therefore offers itself as an opportunity to question the many assumptions that are part of the sense-making process underlying our creative process.},

Our aim in this chapter is to develop the view of participatory action research that has shaped our own theory and practice during recent years. We begin with a short overview of the evolution of our own thinking and the influence of several generations of action research. In our chapter on "Participatory Action Research" for the second edition of this Handbook, we identified several key approaches to action research, the sites and settings where they are most frequently used, several criticisms that have been advanced for each, and key sources to explore them (Kemmis \& McTaggart, 2000). The approaches identified were a somewhat eclectic mix--participatory research, classroom action research, action learning, action science, soft systems approaches, and industrial action research. We summarize those approaches again here but do not reiterate our views of them in this chapter. We acknowledge the influence of each approach on the field and as stimulus to reflection on our own ideas and practices. For our current purposes, we proceed to develop a comprehensive view of social practice and reflect on aspects of our own work that we term "myths, misinterpretations, and mistakes" to move toward reconceptualizing research itself as a social practice.

Résumé
De nombreux cliniciens restent méfiants envers l’apprentissage automatique en raison de préoccupations de longue date concernant les modèles à « boîte noire ». Le terme « boîte noire » sert à désigner des modèles suffisamment complexes pour échapper à une interprétation simple par un humain. Le manque d’interprétabilité des modèles prédictifs peut miner la confiance en ces modèles, en particulier dans le domaine des soins de santé, où tant de décisions sont littéralement des questions de vie ou de mort. Il y a eu récemment une explosion de la recherche consacrée à l’apprentissage automatique explicable visant à répondre à ces préoccupations. L’apprentissage automatique explicable est très prometteur, mais il importe que les cardiologues aient une compréhension critique de ses forces et de ses limites puisqu’ils pourraient le retrouver dans des outils d’aide à la décision clinique ou des rapports de recherche de pointe. Cet article passe en revue les concepts et éléments techniques clés de l’apprentissage automatique explicable, tels qu’ils s’appliquent à la cardiologie. Les concepts clés que nous examinons comprennent l’interprétabilité par rapport à l’explicabilité et les explications globales par rapport aux explications locales. Au nombre des éléments techniques présentés figurent la mesure d’importance des variables à partir de permutations, les arbres de décision de substitution, l’algorithme LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) et les tracés de dépendance partielle. Nous abordons plusieurs limites des éléments techniques d’explicabilité, en attirant l’attention sur le fait que la nature approximative des explications peut mener à l’omission d’informations importantes sur la façon dont les modèles à boîte noire fonctionnent et les fondements de certaines prévisions obtenues à l’aide de ces modèles. Pour conclure, nous proposons une méthode empirique permettant de déterminer quand il est approprié d’utiliser des modèles à boîte noire assortis d’explications plutôt que des modèles interprétables.},

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.},

	abstract = {This article presents individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the PDP by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data-generating model. Through simulated examples and real datasets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

	abstract = {From the 1980s onward, neoliberal governance in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom has emphasized competitive individualism and people have seemingly responded, in kind, by agitating to perfect themselves and their lifestyles. In this study, the authors examine whether cultural changes have coincided with an increase in multidimensional perfectionism in college students over the last 27 years. Their analyses are based on 164 samples and 41,641 American, Canadian, and British college students, who completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Hewitt \& Flett, 1991) between 1989 and 2016 (70.92\% female, Mage = 20.66). Cross-temporal meta-analysis revealed that levels of self-oriented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism, and other-oriented perfectionism have linearly increased. These trends remained when controlling for gender and between-country differences in perfectionism scores. Overall, in order of magnitude of the observed increase, the findings indicate that recent generations of young people perceive that others are more demanding of them, are more demanding of others, and are more demanding of themselves.

In particular, Pakistani women’s attachment to their environment and their environmental concerns are almost always ignored. Shazia Rahman traces the ways in which Pakistani women explore alternative, environmental modes of belonging, examines the vitality of place-based identities within Pakistani culture, and thereby contributes to evolving understandings of Pakistani women—in relation to both their environment and to various discourses of nation and patriarchy. Through an astute analysis of such works as Sabiha Sumar’s Khamosh Pani (2003), Mehreen Jabbar’s Ramchand Pakistani (2008), Sorayya Khan’s Noor (2006), Uzma Aslam Khan’s Trespassing (2003), and Kamila Shamsie’s Burnt Shadows (2009), Rahman illuminates how Pakistani women’s creative works portray how people live with one another, deal with their environment, and intuit their relationship with the spiritual. She considers how literary and cinematic documentation of place-based identities simultaneously critiques and counters stereotypes of Pakistan as a country of religious nationalism and oppressive patriarchy. Rahman’s analysis discloses fresh perspectives for thinking about the relationship between social and environmental justice.},

The system was experienced by about 120 audience and performer participants (35 completed surveys) in controlled (lab) and real-world settings. Feedback on usability and user experience was overall positive, and live interactions demonstrate significant levels of audience creative engagement.

In this work, we propose the PianoTree VAE, a novel tree-structure extension upon VAE aiming to fit the polyphonic music learning. The experiments prove the validity of the PianoTree VAE via (i)-semantically meaningful latent code for polyphonic segments; (ii)-more satisfiable reconstruction aside of decent geometry learned in the latent space; (iii)-this model's benefits to the variety of the downstream music generation.},

In this article, I explore this question by drawing on my own experiences of reconsidering essentialist and representationalist assumptions, and becoming a sociomaterial researcher. My exploration draws on my experiences of conducting a qualitative longitudinal case study at the Swedish Migration Board. Specifically, I show what it can mean to ‘invite materiality’ into interviews, examine the conditions of possibility to become in certain ways by tracing the genealogy of practices, and engage with data relationally rather than categorically. By accounting for my experience of working through these practices, I aim to develop and articulate an understanding of what the ontological position underlying a sociomaterial approach implies for epistemology, and of how we can act (or, rather, intra-act) more creatively and responsibly as sociomaterial researchers. Moreover, I highlight differences in the kinds of knowledge that a sociomaterial approach grounded in relational and performative onto-epistemologies, as opposed to a socio-material approach, grounded in critical realism, produce about the unfolding of organizational practices—specifically, the practices unfolding in the reception area of the Swedish Migration Board. The paper contributes to the current debate on sociomaterial approaches, and in particular to the development of practices available to draw upon for researchers taking a sociomaterial approach.},

Drawing on musical examples from various underground electronic music genres and on interviews with electronic musicians, this essay addresses such questions as: What is a sampler, and how does the sampling process resonate with or diverge from other traditions of instrument-playing? How do electronic musicians use the ‘automated’ mechanisms of digital instruments to achieve nuanced musical expression and cultural commentary? What are some political implications of presenting sampled and processed sounds in a reconfigured compositional environment? By exploring these issues, I hope to counter the over-simplified, uninformed critical claims that sampling is a process of ‘theft’ and ‘automation’, and instead offer insight into the myriad and complex musical and political dimensions of sampling in electronic music production.},

The point of departure is the phenomenology of musical instruments, which leads to the exploration of designed artefacts as extensions of human cognition – as scaffolding onto which we delegate parts of our cognitive processes. The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an
              epistemic tool
              : a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture.},

	abstract = {Understanding and interpreting classification decisions of automated image classification systems is of high value in many applications, as it allows to verify the reasoning of the system and provides additional information to the human expert. Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest. We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package.},

	abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has experienced a significant growth over the last few years. This is due to the widespread application of machine learning, particularly deep learning, that has led to the development of highly accurate models that lack explainability and interpretability. A plethora of methods to tackle this problem have been proposed, developed and tested, coupled with several studies attempting to define the concept of explainability and its evaluation. This systematic review contributes to the body of knowledge by clustering all the scientific studies via a hierarchical system that classifies theories and notions related to the concept of explainability and the evaluation approaches for XAI methods. The structure of this hierarchy builds on top of an exhaustive analysis of existing taxonomies and peer-reviewed scientific material. Findings suggest that scholars have identified numerous notions and requirements that an explanation should meet in order to be easily understandable by end-users and to provide actionable information that can inform decision making. They have also suggested various approaches to assess to what degree machine-generated explanations meet these demands. Overall, these approaches can be clustered into human-centred evaluations and evaluations with more objective metrics. However, despite the vast body of knowledge developed around the concept of explainability, there is not a general consensus among scholars on how an explanation should be defined, and how its validity and reliability assessed. Eventually, this review concludes by critically discussing these gaps and limitations, and it defines future research directions with explainability as the starting component of any artificial intelligent system.},

To better match co-creation needs, we developed AI-steering tools, consisting of Voice Lanes that restrict content generation to particular voices; Example-Based Sliders to control the similarity of generated content to an existing example; Semantic Sliders to nudge music generation in high-level directions (happy/sad, conventional/surprising); and Multiple Alternatives of generated content to audition and choose from. In a summative study (N=21), we discovered the tools not only increased users' trust, control, comprehension, and sense of collaboration with the AI, but also contributed to a greater sense of self-efficacy and ownership of the composition relative to the AI.},

@phdthesis{hodrobUsingGraphicalNotation2012,
	title = {On {Using} a {Graphical} {Notation} in {Ontology} {Engineering}},
	abstract = {The enormous need for well engineered ontologies is growing rapidly, as the need for
ontologies is increasing in many application areas such as data integration, the semantic web,
knowledge engineering, enhanced information retrieval, etc. Due to the central role ontologies
are playing, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed the Web Ontology Language
(OWL) as a language to author ontologies. However, OWL, like many other similar ontology
languages, does not provide a practical and methodological means for ontology engineering.
In addition, one is required to understand the logical foundation underpinning OWL, which is
very difficult for domain experts. For an ontology language to be easily understood by domain
experts it must be close to the natural language they speak and the ‘logic’ they use. Also, it
should have a graphical notation to enable simple and conceptual modeling. The expressive,
methodological, and graphical capabilities of Object-Role Modeling (ORM) make it a good
candidate for use in ontology engineering. The modeling approach (ORM) selected here is one
of the richest graphical modelling approaches and the knowledge and practice of it is easy to
be acquired at a short period of time. The second version of OWL (OWL 2) is a recommended
web ontology language from W3C which contains the majority of the constructs to be used for
building any needed ontology. Many reasoners such as RacerPro 2.0, Pellet, Hermit, Fact++
and others support reasoning ontologies represented in OWL 2 which is created using the
description logic SROIQ (characterized by expressivity and decidability). In this research, we
(i) map the most commonly used ORM constructs to OWL 2 using SROIQ Description Logic
and, on the other hand, we (ii) extend the ORM notation to cover all OWL 2 constructs not
currently covered by ORM. By doing so, we combine the strengths of both ORM and the
W3C-recommended Web Ontology Language (OWL). This creates a framework that allows
one to engineer OWL ontologies graphically using ORM.},

Three activities have been identified in this process: reverse engineering, restructuring and forward engineering. The aim of Reverse Engineering is to output a possible conceptual model on the basis of the code in which the ontology is implemented. The goal of Restructuring is to reorganize this initial conceptual model into a new conceptual model, which is built bearing in mind the use of the restructured ontology by the ontology/application that reuses it. Finally, the objective of Forward Engineering is output a new implementation of the ontology. The paper also discusses how the ontological reengineering process has been applied to the Standard-Units ontology [18], which is included in a Chemical-Elements [12] ontology. These two ontologies will be included in a Monatomic-Ions and Environmental-Pollutants ontologies.},

The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an epistemic tool: a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture.},

It has been well documented that Benjamin’s long-lasting friendship with Bertolt Brecht and the latter’s dramatic theory had a profound influence on his thinking about this notion. Brecht's techniques of interruption and juxtaposition in the practice of epic theater were in close relationship with Benjamin’s use of montage as a mechanism to “liberate” meaning. Despite Theodor Adorno’s and Gershom Scholem’s attempt to situate Benjamin’s thought in a different aesthetic tradition, Brecht’s understanding of Verfremdung (estrangement) and Benjamin’s idea of “shock” are often deemed identical. In this paper I compare both concepts, looking at their points of coincidence and tension. I also relate their development to one of the most telling friendships in the history of twentieth-century philosophy.},

It is more a textbook on the psychophysics of pitch than a review of recent research. There are several reasons for this, as listed below: a) Very few scientists, even those working on pitch perception, are aware of all the intricacies involved. b) Textbooks on psychophysics or physiology of hearing in general are either outdated — the development has been very fast the last five years — or not authorative on this subject. c) The older literature on the residue is inaccessible as a consequence, an overview is difficult to obtain. d) The publications include many subtleties in psychophysical experiments or advanced mathematical details of signal generation which make them difficult to understand for physiologists, etc. e) There exist many misconceptions about the relevance of certain physiological experiments for pitch perception (and vice versa). f) The problem of the residue is of prime importance for speech as well as for music, but a comprehensive account of the subject does not exist. g) In some instances psychophysical or physiological studies are reported that seem to indicate that the “residue” is about to be discovered again. Such situations may be prevented by the existence of a general text.},

Considering that theory; visual and auditory material should be presented simultaneously to reinforce the retention of a mathematical learned topic, a carefully computer-assisted learning (CAL) module is designed for development of a multimedia tutorial for our suggested mathematical topic. The designed CAL module is a multimedia tutorial computer package with visual and/or auditory material. So, via suggested computer package, Multi-Sensory associative memories and classical conditioning theories are practically applicable at an educational field (a children classroom). It is noticed that comparative practical results obtained are interesting for field application of CAL package with and without associated teacher's voice. Finally, the presented study highly recommends application of a novel teaching trend aiming to improve quality of children mathematical learning performance.},

Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1958) argued that deﬁnitions are not sufﬁcient to determine meaning or to legislate correct usage of words. For both singular terms and general concepts, meaning is meaning-as-use, proceeding via examples that instruct within an already existing normative structure. Once we are clear on the ways in which use presupposes a normative structure, I believe we will understand better the meaning of sustainability and its normative basis. On this view, sustainability will be vague and contested (Jacobs in Fairness and futurity. Oxford University Press, New York, pp 21–45, 1999) but not meaningless. And we will not have to be worried about the plethora of deﬁnitions.},

The second one is to grant them sociality, and to tie them to the social fabric. The third one is to consider them as a semiotic construction, and to relate agency with building of meaning. The originality of science studies comes from the impossibility of clearly differentiating between these three resources. Microbes, neutrinos of DNA are at the same time natural, social and discourse. They are real, human and semiotic entities in the same breath. The article explores the consequences of this peculiar situation which has not been underlined before science studies forced us to retie the links between these three resources. The actor-network theory as developed by Callon and his colleagues is an attempt to invent a vocabulary to deal with this new situation. The article reviews those difficulties and tries to overcome them by showing how they may be used to account for the construction of entities, that is for the attribution of nature, society and meaning.},

The point of departure is the phenomenology of musical instruments, which leads to the exploration of designed artefacts as extensions of human cognition – as scaffolding onto which we delegate parts of our cognitive processes. The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an epistemic tool: a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture.},

Considerable evidence has shown that one-pass authentication fails to meet security needs when the workforce work from home. The recent advent of continuous authentication (CA) has shown the potential to solve this predicament. In this paper, we propose NF-Heart, a physiological-based CA system utilizing a ballistocardiogram (BCG). The key insight is that the BCG measures the body's micro-movements produced by the recoil force of the body in reaction to the cardiac ejection of blood, and we can infer cardiac biometrics from BCG signals. To measure BCG, we deploy a lightweight accelerometer on an office chair, turning the common chair into a smart continuous identity "scanner". We design multiple stages of signal processing to decompose and transform the distorted BCG signals so that the effects of motion artifacts and dynamic variations are eliminated. User-specific fiducial features are then extracted from the processed BCG signals for authentication. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 105 subjects in terms of verification accuracy, security, robustness, and long-term availability. The results demonstrate that NF-Heart achieves a mean balanced accuracy of 96.45\% and a median equal error rate of 3.83\% for CA. The proposed signal processing pipeline is effective in addressing various practical disturbances.},

Focusing on the health context, this research examines the effectiveness of narrative-based feedback in motivating physical activity behaviors and underlying attitudes over longitudinal periods. After collecting two weeks of baseline physical activity levels, N=39 participants installed our smartphone application, WhoIsZuki. The WhoIsZuki app supports goal setting and semi-automated activity tracking, and it provides an ambient display that visually encodes these tracked activities as well as progress toward goals. Half of participants received a version of the interface that supplied behavioral feedback in the form of a multi-chapter episodic narrative, while the other half received a control condition version that provided an aesthetically-similar visualization but without any characterization, episodic structure, dramatic effect, or other narrative elements. After interacting with these versions for four months, our analysis showed that participants receiving the multi-chapter narrative feedback performed more physical activity, achieved more goals, experienced more positive psychological shifts, and overall engaged more meaningfully with the digital intervention.},

We present a comprehensive set of deterministic transformations that can be inserted as distinct layers into the computational graph of a trained generative neural network and applied during inference. In addition, we present a novel algorithm for analysing the deep generative model and clustering features based on their spatial activation maps. This allows features to be grouped together based on spatial similarity in an unsupervised fashion. This results in the meaningful manipulation of sets of features that correspond to the generation of a broad array of semantically significant features of the generated images. We outline this framework, demonstrating our results on state-of-the-art deep generative models trained on several image datasets. We show how it allows for the direct manipulation of semantically meaningful aspects of the generative process as well as allowing for a broad range of expressive outcomes.},

	abstract = {Interactive machine learning (ML) allows a music performer to digitally represent musical actions (via gestural interfaces) and affect their musical output in real-time. Processing musical actions (termed performance gestures) with ML is useful because it predicts and maps often-complex biometric data. ML models can therefore be used to create novel interactions with musical systems, game-engines, and networked analogue devices. Wekinator is a free open-source software for ML (based on the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis – WEKA - framework) which has been widely used, since 2009, to build supervised predictive models when developing real-time interactive systems. This is because it is accessible in its format (i.e. a graphical user interface – GUI) and simplified approach to ML. Significantly, it allows model training via gestural interfaces through demonstration. However, Wekinator offers the user several models to build predictive systems with. This paper explores which ML models (in Wekinator) are the most useful for predicting an output in the context of interactive music composition. We use two performance gestures for piano, with opposing datasets, to train available ML models, investigate compositional outcomes and frame the investigation. Our results show ML model choice is important for mapping performance gestures because of disparate mapping accuracies and behaviours found between all Wekinator ML models.},

	abstract = {Interactive generative musical performance provides a suitable model for communication because, like natural linguistic discourse, it involves an exchange of ideas that is unpredictable, collaborative, and emergent. Here we show that interactive improvisation between two musicians is characterized by activation of perisylvian language areas linked to processing of syntactic elements in music, including inferior frontal gyrus and posterior superior temporal gyrus, and deactivation of angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, brain structures directly implicated in semantic processing of language. These findings support the hypothesis that musical discourse engages language areas of the brain specialized for processing of syntax but in a manner that is not contingent upon semantic processing. Therefore, we argue that neural regions for syntactic processing are not domain-specific for language but instead may be domain-general for communication.},

	abstract = {First performed at the midpoint of the twentieth century, John Cage's \textit{4'33"} , a composition conceived of without a single musical note, is among the most celebrated and ballyhooed cultural gestures in the history of modern music. A meditation on the act of listening and the nature of performance, Cage's controversial piece became the iconic statement of the meaning of silence in art and is a landmark work of American music.  In this book, Kyle Gann, one of the nation's leading music critics, explains \textit{4'33"} as a unique moment in American culture and musical composition. Finding resemblances and resonances of \textit{4'33"} in artworks as wide-ranging as the paintings of the Hudson River School and the music of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, he provides much-needed cultural context for this fundamentally challenging and often misunderstood piece. Gann also explores Cage's craft, describing in illuminating detail the musical, philosophical, and even environmental influences that informed this groundbreaking piece of music. Having performed \textit{4'33"} himself and as a composer in his own right, Gann offers the reader both an expert's analysis and a highly personal interpretation of Cage's most divisive work.},

Under neoliberalism, when a World-State is emerging, the capitalists occupy an overwhelming position.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ‘neoliberal subject’ can be described as subjected to a universal commodification. But a realistic understanding supposes to confront this subject with the contradictory plurality of this régime of hegemony. The subject is ‘interpellated’ (see Althusser) from all sides of this social triangle, across all the scales of social life. Only in this local and universal context can the potential of the ordinary human being appear.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

However, it is difficult to address its function since the usual conception of notation in music scholarship is at odds with studying performance in the first place. This article presents a methodological outline for an ethnomusicology of music notation by investigating the musicality of notation not in terms of its representation of musical structures, but in terms of its mediation of the social and creative agency of musicians. It is suggested that, rather than detracting from musical reality, notation composes musical cultures. This constructive work is simultaneously ontological and ethical. It is described in terms of three distinct processes, namely mobilization, entextualization and remediation. In doing so, this article presents an interdisciplinary approach to a topic that has traditionally defined the disciplinary centre of music scholarship.},

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {In the past five years the collaborative relationship between composer and performer has emerged as an important field of enquiry. Challenging the assumptions of distinct roles and creativity in solitude, recent research publications by Östersjö, Clarke/Cook/Harrison/Thomas, Roche, Hayden/Windsor and Heyde/Fitch have examined their own creative practices to explore many different models of collaborative relationships. The author’s doctoral research in this field examined the collaborations on ten new works for solo piano, one of which is the graphically notated score, Not Music Yet (2012), by Australian composer, David Young. This article explores how Young’s use of graphic notation alongside symbiotic collaborative strategies catalysed a metamorphosis of the collaborative process. In 2011, the author, a concert pianist, commissioned Young to compose a new work for solo piano. Young’s decision to notate the score as a large watercolour painting served as both a point of resistance and a catalyst in the collaborative process. The article examines Young’s strategies of managing and manipulating the author’s interpretation, while affording the author control over fundamental compositional decisions. The author’s process of creating a performable realisation of the score – utilising sonic and pianistic experimentation with a wide variety of extended techniques – is also examined. With reference to the author’s doctoral research, which examined the effects of notational practices, imbalances of authority, and external pressures on the collaborative process, the article provides insights into the impact of graphic notation on the collaborative process and shows how Young’s specific use of interdependent notational and collaborative strategies can provide a useful model for future collaborators and researchers while also facilitating new perspectives on the conventional roles and responsibilities of composer and performer.},

Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that the model learns a manifold of embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments, meaningfully interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic and expressive.},

The NEWT uses time-distributed multilayer perceptrons with periodic activations to implicitly learn nonlinear transfer functions that encode the characteristics of a target timbre. Once trained, a NEWT can produce complex timbral evolutions by simple affine transformations of its input and output signals. We paired the NEWT with a differentiable noise synthesiser and reverb and found it capable of generating realistic musical instrument performances with only 260k total model parameters, conditioned on F0 and loudness features. We compared our method to state-of-the-art benchmarks with a multi-stimulus listening test and the Fr{\textbackslash}'echet Audio Distance and found it performed competitively across the tested timbral domains. Our method significantly outperformed the benchmarks in terms of generation speed, and achieved real-time performance on a consumer CPU, both with and without FastNEWT, suggesting it is a viable basis for future creative sound design tools.},

	abstract = {Silent speech recognition (SSR) allows users to speak to the device without making a sound, avoiding being overheard or disturbing others. Compared to the video-based approach, wireless signal-based SSR can work when the user is wearing a mask and has fewer privacy concerns. However, previous wireless-based systems are still far from well-studied, e.g. they are only evaluated in corpus with highly limited size, making them only feasible for interaction with dozens of deterministic commands. In this paper, we present mSilent, a millimeter-wave (mmWave) based SSR system that can work in the general corpus containing thousands of daily conversation sentences. With the strong recognition capability, mSilent not only supports the more complex interaction with assistants, but also enables more general applications in daily life such as communication and input. To extract fine-grained articulatory features, we build a signal processing pipeline that uses a clustering-selection algorithm to separate articulatory gestures and generates a multi-scale detrended spectrogram (MSDS). To handle the complexity of the general corpus, we design an end-to-end deep neural network that consists of a multi-branch convolutional front-end and a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence back-end. We collect a general corpus dataset of 1,000 daily conversation sentences that contains 21K samples of bi-modality data (mmWave and video). Our evaluation shows that mSilent achieves a 9.5\% average word error rate (WER) at a distance of 1.5m, which is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art video-based approach. We also explore deploying mSilent in two typical scenarios of text entry and in-car assistant, and the less than 6\% average WER demonstrates the potential of mSilent in general daily applications.},

Learning a joint representation of these modalities should yield deeper and more useful representations.Previous generative approaches to multi-modal input either do not learn a joint distribution or require additional computation to handle missing data. Here, we introduce a multimodal variational autoencoder (MVAE) that uses a product-of-experts inference network and a sub-sampled training paradigm to solve the multi-modal inference problem. Notably, our model shares parameters to efficiently learn under any combination of missing modalities. We apply the MVAE on four datasets and match state-of-the-art performance using many fewer parameters. In addition, we show that the MVAE is directly applicable to weakly-supervised learning, and is robust to incomplete supervision. We then consider two case studies, one of learning image transformations---edge detection, colorization,  segmentation---as a set of modalities, followed by one of machine translation between two languages. We find appealing results across this range of tasks.},

Several implementation issues are then examined. The issue of generalization is studied next. Several measures to improve network generalization are discussed, including cross validation, choice of network size, network pruning, constructive algorithms and regularization. Recurrent networks are then studied, both in the fixed point mode, with the recurrent backpropagation algorithm, and in the sequential mode, with the unfolding in time algorithm. A reference is also made to time-delay neural networks. The section also includes brief mention of a large number of applications of multilayer perceptrons, with pointers to the bibliography.},

	title = {Musical {Audio} {Synthesis} {Using} {Autoencoding} {Neural} {Nets}},
	abstract = {With an optimal network topology and tuning of hyperparameters, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) may be trained to learn a mapping from low level audio features to one or more higher-level representations. Such artiﬁcial neural networks are commonly used in classiﬁcation and regression settings to perform arbitrary tasks. In this work we suggest repurposing autoencoding neural networks as musical audio synthesizers. We offer an interactive musical audio synthesis system that uses feedforward artiﬁcial neural networks for musical audio synthesis, rather than discriminative or regression tasks. In our system an ANN is trained on frames of low-level features. A high level representation of the musical audio is learned though an autoencoding neural net. Our real-time synthesis system allows one to interact directly with the parameters of the model and generate musical audio in real time. This work therefore proposes the exploitation of neural networks for creative musical applications.},

It is an information transmission process which can be described through the Shannon-Weaver Theory of Mathematical Communication. Musical borrowing is proposed as a method in sonification which can aid the information transmission process as the composer’s and listener’s shared musical knowledge is used. This article describes the compositional process of Wasgiischwashäsch (2017) which uses Rossini’s William Tell Overture (1829) to sonify datasets relating to climate change in Switzerland. It concludes that the familiarity of audiences with the original piece, and the humorous effect produced by the distortion of a well-known piece, contribute to a more effective transmission process.},

@article{crossMusicCognitionCulture,

	abstract = {We seem able to define the biological foundations for our musicality within a clear and unitary framework, yet music itself does not appear so clearly definable. Music is different things and does different things in different cultures; the bundles of elements and functions that are music for any given culture may overlap minimally with those of another culture, even for those cultures where “music” constitutes a discrete and identifiable category of human activity in its own right. The dynamics of culture, of music as cultural praxis, are neither necessarily reducible, nor easily relatable, to the dynamics of our biologies. Yet music appears to be a universal human competence. Recent evolutionary theory, however, affords a means for exploring things biological and cultural within a framework in which they are at least commensurable. The adoption of this perspective shifts the focus of the search for the foundations of music away from the mature and particular expression of music within a specific culture or situation and on to the human capacity for musicality. This paper will survey recent research that examines that capacity and its evolutionary origins in the light of a definition of music that embraces music’s multifariousness. It will be suggested that music, like speech, is a product of both our biologies and our social interactions; that music is a necessary and integral dimension of human development; and that music may have played a central role in the evolution of the modern human mind.},

Here, we put this belief to a test, by empirically investigating coordination within a large group of 16 musicians performing collective free improvisation—a genre in which improvisers aim at creating music that is as complex and unprecedented as possible without relying on shared plans or on an external conductor. We show that musicians freely improvising within a large ensemble can achieve significant levels of coordination, both at the level of their musical actions (i.e., their individual decisions to play or to stop playing) and at the level of their directional intentions (i.e., their intentions to change or to support the music produced by the group). Taken together, these results invite us to reconsider the range and scope of actions achievable by large groups, and to explore alternative organizational models that emphasize decentralized and unscripted forms of collective behavior.},

Directed song, artist, and musical genre networks are created from the data, allowing the application of social network metrics to quantify various trends and characteristics. In addition, a method of influence rank is proposed, unify- ing song-level networks to higher-level artist and genre networks via a collapse-and-sum approach. Such metrics are used to help interpret and describe interesting patterns of musical influence in sample-based music suitable for musicological analysis. Empirical results and visualizations are also presented, suggesting that sampled-based influence networks follow a power-law degree distribution; heavy influence of funk, soul, and disco music on modern hip-hop, R\&B, and electronic music; and other musicological results.},

Secondly, for each hypothetical source location in this possible plane, the Doppler effect is removed through the integration of sound pressure. Taking advantage of the de-Dopplerized signals, the moving time difference of arrival (MTDOA) is calculated, and the sound source is located based on triangulation. Thirdly, the estimated sound source location is compared to the original hypothetical location and the deviations are recorded. Because the real sound source location leads to zero deviation, the sound source can be finally located by minimizing the deviation matrix. Simulations have shown the superiority of MTDOA method over traditional triangulation in case of moving sound sources. The MTDOA method can be used to locate moving sound sources with as high resolution as DAMAS beamforming, as shown in the experiments, offering thus a new method for locating moving sound sources.},

	abstract = {There is an expanding field of research into how making or listening to music can improve wellbeing. As a spontaneous, social, creative nonverbal process unfolding in real time, musical improvisation between individuals is a unique psychological phenomenon distinct from other areas of musical activity. It may therefore have an influence on health or wellbeing distinct from other musical behaviours, and from other components of a musical intervention. Given the psychological complexity of this behaviour it is important to establish the parameters of improvisation, the effects on health or wellbeing that are perceived or claimed for it, and any mechanisms understood to bring about these effects. To establish this, literature was reviewed that explicitly investigates or theorises about the capacity of musical improvisation to influence health or wellbeing. Only work examining its application within music therapy was identified. The behaviours and interactions that constitute improvisation during music therapy are clearly defined. Improvisation in music therapy is seen to have specific benefits for particular populations including the amelioration of neurological damage, improvements in mental health conditions, reductions in stress and anxiety, and improved communication and joint attention behaviours in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Four unique characteristics of musical improvisation are identified as underlying these effects: its potential to link conscious with unconscious processes, the demands on attention of absorption in a creative process, the non-verbal social and creative interaction experienced, and the capacity for expressing difficult or repressed emotions without having to articulate these verbally. Although improvisation is undertaken in music therapy for a purpose distinct from that of improvisation in other contexts, its processes can be seen as substantively similar, suggesting that improvising in itself may offer intrinsic benefits to health or wellbeing to broader populations and outwith the therapeutic context. Based on this review, a model is proposed for how improvisation in music can influence the health or wellbeing of those involved.},

	abstract = {Musical performance can be thought of in multimodal terms - physical interaction with musical instruments produces sound output, often while the performer is visually reading a score. Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design merges tenets of HCI and musical instrument practice. Audiovisual performance and other forms of multimedia might benefit from multimodal thinking. This keynote revisits two decades of interactive music practice that has paralleled the development of the field of multimodal interaction research. The BioMuse was an early digital musical instrument system using EMG muscle sensing that was extended by a second mode of sensing, allowing effort and position to be two complementary modalities [1]. The Haptic Wave applied principles of cross-modal information display to create a haptic audio editor enabling visually impaired audio producers to 'feel' audio waveforms they could not see in a graphical user interface [2]. VJ culture extends the idea of music DJs to create audiovisual cultural experiences. AVUIs were a set of creative coding tools that enabled the convergence of performance UI and creative visual output [3]. The Orchestra of Rocks is a continuing collaboration with visual artist Uta Kogelsberger that has manifested itself through physical and virtual forms - allowing multimodality over time [4]. Be it a physical exhibition in a gallery or audio reactive 3D animation on YouTube 360, the multiple modes in which an artwork is articulated support its original conceptual foundations. These four projects situate multimodal interaction at the heart of artistic research.},

	abstract = {Generating music has a few notable differences from generating images and videos. First, music is an art of time, necessitating a temporal model. Second, music is usually composed of multiple instruments/tracks with their own temporal dynamics, but collectively they unfold over time interdependently. Lastly, musical notes are often grouped into chords, arpeggios or melodies in polyphonic music, and thereby introducing a chronological ordering of notes is not naturally suitable. In this paper, we propose three models for symbolic multi-track music generation under the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The three models, which differ in the underlying assumptions and accordingly the network architectures, are referred to as the jamming model, the composer model and the hybrid model. We trained the proposed models on a dataset of over one hundred thousand bars of rock music and applied them to generate piano-rolls of ﬁve tracks: bass, drums, guitar, piano and strings. A few intratrack and inter-track objective metrics are also proposed to evaluate the generative results, in addition to a subjective user study. We show that our models can generate coherent music of four bars right from scratch (i.e. without human inputs). We also extend our models to human-AI cooperative music generation: given a speciﬁc track composed by human, we can generate four additional tracks to accompany it.

The first-known graphically scored works of the postwar era, the Projections were immediately championed by Feldman's friend John Cage in the language of his budding philosophy of non-intention, a framework of thought largely alien to Feldman. In later years, Feldman instead explained the Projections through the discourse of abstract-expressionist painting, substituting its model of willful creative action for Cage's Zen-inspired doctrine of aesthetic indifference. Yet the story behind his graphic notation is more tangled still, for its sources included both Edgard Varèse and Stefan Wolpe, composers whose spatialized vision of sound influenced Feldman's new conception of the creative act. An examination of the origin and reception of the Projections offers insight into the forces that catalyzed experimental notation in postwar New York and the rationales that were ultimately ascribed to it.},

	abstract = {Resumo Este trabalho teve por finalidade mapear a produção científica internacional acerca da educação musical de surdos ou aprendizagem musical de surdos em uma das principais bases de dados, a ISI Web of Knowledge/Web of Science, admitindo como recorte temporal o intervalo entre os anos 1956 e 2017. Buscou-se identificar os principais artigos a respeito da temática, atentando para a análise das características, das barreiras e das práticas exitosas desse tipo de educação. Utilizou-se um estudo bibliométrico em que foram identificados 217 artigos. Os dados foram tratados por meio do software HistCiteTM. Os resultados sinalizaram para a identificação dos principais periódicos, dos artigos mais citados e dos principais autores da área. Dentre as principais características da educação musical de surdos, observou-se que deve ter foco na imitação das melodias e a participação essencial da família nesse processo. A ausência da atitude de escuta e a dificuldade de comunicação são as principais barreiras. A realização de entrevistas para a definição de critérios nos marcos da educação musical de surdos, a realização de inventários de desenvolvimento e a avaliação cognitiva e auditiva são as principais práticas desenvolvidas na área. Inferiu-se, com isso, que ao longo do período estudado o foco das pesquisas migrou dos estudos acerca do problema da surdez em si para o papel da educação musical na aquisição de competências básicas pelos surdos, bem como para os estudos acerca da diversidade e do preconceito relacionados com a pessoa surda. De igual modo, constatou-se que, a despeito do papel da escola, do professor e da infraestrutura pedagógica na aprendizagem musical, os estudos desenvolvidos abordaram como principais atores os pais e as crianças e os adultos com surdez.},

Our experiments show that MusicLM outperforms previous systems both in audio quality and adherence to the text description. Moreover, we demonstrate that MusicLM can be conditioned on both text and a melody in that it can transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text caption. To support future research, we publicly release MusicCaps, a dataset composed of 5.5k music-text pairs, with rich text descriptions provided by human experts.},

At each resolution level, MGVAE employs higher order message passing to encode the graph while learning to partition it into mutually exclusive clusters and coarsening into a lower resolution that eventually creates a hierarchy of latent distributions. MGVAE then constructs a hierarchical generative model to variationally decode into a hierarchy of coarsened graphs. Importantly, our proposed framework is end-to-end permutation equivariant with respect to node ordering. MGVAE achieves competitive results with several generative tasks including general graph generation, molecular generation, unsupervised molecular representation learning to predict molecular properties, link prediction on citation graphs, and graph-based image generation.},

We examine this paradox and aim to resolve it by integrating accounts from cognitive psychology on attention and mind wandering with qualitative phenomenological research on some of the world’s most skilled musicians. We claim that a mode of experience that involves intense attention and what superficially seems like mind wandering is possible. We propose to grasp this different mode of experience with a new concept: “mind surfing”. We suggest that a conjoined consideration of attention’s intensive and selective capacities can partially explain how one can be both focused and freely “surfing” on a “musical wave” at the same time. Finally, we couple this novel and foundational work on attention with a 4E cognition account to show how music acts as an affective and cognitive scaffold, thereby enabling the surfing.},

Using this approach, dubbed ‘Entanglement HCI’, this paper presents Message Ritual – a novel, integrated AI system that encourages the re-framing of memory through machine generated poetics. Embodied within a domestic table lamp, the system listens in on conversations occurring within the home, drawing out key topics and phrases of the day and reconstituting them through machine generated poetry, delivered to household members via SMS upon waking each morning. Participants across four households were asked to live with the lamp over a two week period. We present a diffractive analysis exploring how the lamp becomes with participants and discuss the implications of this method for future HCI research.},

	abstract = {Millimeter wave radar is a promising sensing modality for enabling pervasive and privacy-preserving human sensing. However, the lack of large-scale radar datasets limits the potential of training deep learning models to achieve generalization and robustness. To close this gap, we resort to designing a software pipeline that leverages wealthy video repositories to generate synthetic radar data, but it confronts key challenges including i) multipath reflection and attenuation of radar signals among multiple humans, ii) unconvertible generated data leading to poor generality for various applications, and iii) the class-imbalance issue of videos leading to low model stability. To this end, we design Midas to generate realistic, convertible radar data from videos via two components: (i) a data generation network (DG-Net) combines several key modules, depth prediction, human mesh fitting and multi-human reflection model, to simulate the multipath reflection and attenuation of radar signals to output convertible coarse radar data, followed by a Transformer model to generate realistic radar data; (ii) a variant Siamese network (VS-Net) selects key video clips to eliminate data redundancy for addressing the class-imbalance issue. We implement and evaluate Midas with video data from various external data sources and real-world radar data, demonstrating its great advantages over the state-of-the-art approach for both activity recognition and object detection tasks.

	abstract = {We present MoCaPose, a novel wearable motion capturing (MoCap) approach to continuously track the wearer's upper body's dynamic poses through multi-channel capacitive sensing integrated in fashionable, loose-fitting jackets. Unlike conventional wearable IMU MoCap based on inverse dynamics, MoCaPose decouples the sensor position from the pose system. MoCaPose uses a deep regressor to continuously predict the 3D upper body joints coordinates from 16-channel textile capacitive sensors, unbound by specific applications. The concept is implemented through two prototyping iterations to first solve the technical challenges, then establish the textile integration through fashion-technology co-design towards a design-centric smart garment. A 38-hour dataset of synchronized video and capacitive data from 21 participants was recorded for validation. The motion tracking result was validated on multiple levels from statistics (R2 {\textasciitilde} 0.91) and motion tracking metrics (MP JPE {\textasciitilde} 86mm) to the usability in pose and motion recognition (0.9 F1 for 10-class classification with unsupervised class discovery). The design guidelines impose few technical constraints, allowing the wearable system to be design-centric and usecase-specific. Overall, MoCaPose demonstrates that textile-based capacitive sensing with its unique advantages, can be a promising alternative for wearable motion tracking and other relevant wearable motion recognition applications.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in deploying building-scale, general-purpose, and high-fidelity sensing to drive emerging smart building applications. However, the real-world deployment of such systems is challenging due to the lack of system and architectural support. Most existing sensing systems are purpose-built, consisting of hardware that senses a limited set of environmental facets, typically at low fidelity and for short-term deployment. Furthermore, prior systems with high-fidelity sensing and machine learning fail to scale effectively and have fewer primitives, if any, for privacy and security. For these reasons, IoT deployments in buildings are generally short-lived or done as a proof of concept. We present the design of Mites, a scalable end-to-end hardware-software system for supporting and managing distributed general-purpose sensors in buildings. Our design includes robust primitives for privacy and security, essential features for scalable data management, as well as machine learning to support diverse applications in buildings. We deployed our Mites system and 314 Mites devices in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Hall at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), a fully occupied, five-story university building. We present a set of comprehensive evaluations of our system using a series of microbenchmarks and end-to-end evaluations to show how we achieved our stated design goals. We include five proof-of-concept applications to demonstrate the extensibility of the Mites system to support compelling IoT applications. Finally, we discuss the real-world challenges we faced and the lessons we learned over the five-year journey of our stack’s iterative design, development, and deployment.

	abstract = {Mood, often studied using smartphones, influences human perception, judgment, thought, and behavior. Mood measurements on smartphones face challenges concerning the selection of a proper mood measure and its transfer, or translation, into a digital application (app) that is user-engaging. Addressing these challenges, researchers sometimes end up developing a new interaction design and modifying the classic mood measure for an app. However, the extent to which such design alterations can impact user compliance, user experience, and the accuracy of mood measurements throughout a mood self-tracking study is unclear. In this paper, we explore and investigate how the selection of a mood measure (from two widely used measures) and its design alteration (from three options of classic, chatbot, and interactive designs) impact the (i) validity, (ii) user compliance, and (iii) user experience of mood measurement apps. For this purpose, we conducted a hybrid study with a mixed design in three parts. The first part suggests that a measure's validity can be susceptible to design modifications and introduces the concept of measure's resilience which can be essential when modifying the interaction design of a measurement tool. The second part discovers that both the type and design of the chosen measure can impact user compliance. This part also portrays a more complete picture of user compliance by demonstrating the use of several variables to investigate compliance. This investigation reveals that user compliance is not just about the response duration or length of a measurement tool. The final part finds that a measure or its design does not significantly influence the user experience for a well-designed app. In this part, we also discover which user experience criteria are more impactful for improving user compliance when designing mood tracking (or mood self-tracking) tools. Our results further suggest that, for a resilient measure, the interactive design is more likely to attract users and have higher user compliance and satisfaction as a whole. Ultimately, choosing a measure or design alternative would be a three-way trade-off between the measure's validity (or accuracy), user compliance, and user satisfaction, which researchers have to prioritize. A successful mood measurement with a smartphone needs to balance both concepts of app quality and assessment quality.},

To realize this, we design a deep neural network model. It first automatically correlate mmWave point clouds to certain human joints and extracts useful fused features from two modalities. Then, the features are refined by predicting 2D joints and silhouette. Finally, we regress pose and shape parameters and feed them to SMPL model to generate the 3D human meshes. We build a prototype on commercial mmWave radar and camera. The experimental results demonstrate that with the integration of multi-modality strengths, MI-Mesh can effectively recover human meshes on dynamic motions and across different conditions.},

	abstract = {Morality plays a fundamental role in how we perceive information while greatly influencing our decisions and judgements. Controversial topics, including vaccination, abortion, racism, and sexuality, often elicit opinions and attitudes that are not solely based on evidence but rather reflect moral worldviews. Recent advances in natural language processing have demonstrated that moral values can be gauged in human-generated textual content. Here, we design a range of language representation models fine-tuned to capture exactly the moral nuances in text, called MoralBERT. We leverage annotated moral data from three distinct sources: Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook user-generated content covering various socially relevant topics. This approach broadens linguistic diversity and potentially enhances the models' ability to comprehend morality in various contexts. We also explore a domain adaptation technique and compare it to the standard fine-tuned BERT model, using two different frameworks for moral prediction: single-label and multi-label. We compare in-domain approaches with conventional models relying on lexicon-based techniques, as well as a Machine Learning classifier with Word2Vec representation. Our results showed that in-domain prediction models significantly outperformed traditional models. While the single-label setting reaches a higher accuracy than previously achieved for the task when using BERT pretrained models. Experiments in an out-of-domain setting, instead, suggest that further work is needed for existing domain adaptation techniques to generalise between different social media platforms, especially for the multi-label task. The investigations and outcomes from this study pave the way for further exploration, enabling a more profound comprehension of moral narratives about controversial social issues.},

Specifically, we develop Mo{\textbackslash}{\textasciicircum}usai, a cascading two-stage latent diffusion model that can generate multiple minutes of high-quality stereo music at 48kHz from textual descriptions. Moreover, our model features high efficiency, which enables real-time inference on a single consumer GPU with a reasonable speed. Through experiments and property analyses, we show our model's competence over a variety of criteria compared with existing music generation models.

	abstract = {Although still not fully understood, sleep is known to play an important role in learning and in pruning synaptic connections. From the active inference perspective, this can be cast as learning parameters of a generative model and Bayesian model reduction, respectively. In this article, we show how to reduce dimensionality of the latent space of such a generative model, and hence model complexity, in deep active inference during training through a similar process. While deep active inference uses deep neural networks for state space construction, an issue remains in that the dimensionality of the latent space must be specified beforehand. We investigate two methods that are able to prune the latent space of deep active inference models. The first approach functions similar to sleep and performs model reduction post hoc. The second approach is a novel method which is more similar to reflection, operates during training and displays “aha” moments when the model is able to reduce latent space dimensionality. We show for two well-known simulated environments that model performance is retained in the first approach and only diminishes slightly in the second approach. We also show that reconstructions from a real world example are indistinguishable before and after reduction. We conclude that the most important difference constitutes a trade-off between training time and model performance in terms of accuracy and the ability to generalize, via minimization of model complexity.},

These distances reflect the type of their relationship, and changes in these distances reflect the evolution over time of their relationship. Human-like autonomous virtual agents should be also equipped with such capability to simulate natural interactions in virtual worlds. First we model the space around an agent as a probability distribution function which reflects at each point in the space the importance of that point to the agent. The agent updates dynamically this function according to (1) his relation and distance to other agents in the virtual space, (2) his face orientation, and (3) the evolution of the relationship over time as a stranger agent may become a friend. We demonstrate the concept on a multi-agent platform and show that space-aware agents exhibit better natural behavior.},

We show that MIDI-VAE can perform style transfer on symbolic music by automatically changing pitches, dynamics and instruments of a music piece from, e.g., a Classical to a Jazz style. We evaluate the efficacy of the style transfer by training separate style validation classifiers. Our model can also interpolate between short pieces of music, produce medleys and create mixtures of entire songs. The interpolations smoothly change pitches, dynamics and instrumentation to create a harmonic bridge between two music pieces. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful attempt at applying neural style transfer to complete musical compositions.},

              This article documents the resolution of a problem encountered during the design of a semi-permanent interactive sound and video installation currently being installed at a tram station located in Dublin, Ireland. This artwork generates video and multi-channel sound output in real time, responding to changes in traffic patterns on an adjacent street. While the visuals are composed from pre-recorded content, the sound environment explores the use of site-specific sound within public urban space by sampling and processing sounds that occur naturally in and around the station. Regulations involving the artwork's volume resulted in the sound output being reduced to a level at which it was too subtle to be noticed amidst the busy activity of the station. It was therefore necessary to strengthen the artwork's aural presence without interfering with the subtleties of the site-specific sound environment. A dynamic field of sine tones and rhythmic glitches was composed to augment the more subtle sounds of the installation. This juxtaposition of site-specific sound with compositional structures associated with the popular musical genre known as
              microsound
              proved to be effective, calling attention to the mediated sound environment even at low volume levels and balancing the artwork's presence with the other functions of the site.},

Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are "metaphors we live by"—metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them.

Model-based signal processing methods for estimating
the model parameters and implementing an e cient violin body model for use with physical modeling synthesis is described. The main approach is to extract the
lowest modes of the violin body for fully parametrized
implementation of these resonances using digital  ltering. The advantage of this approach is the capability
of adjusting the parameters of body modes, such as the
resonance frequencies a ecting the sound quality in the

The method for extracting music from the picture is developed as follows: (a) the image is divided into some squares and frequency components are extracted from each square by two-dimensional FFT, and then (b) the frequency components of each square are transformed into musical pitches. A method to arrange the music by reflecting features of the image is also provided.},

In this paper, we propose MG-VAE, a music generative model based on VAE (Variational Auto-Encoder) that is capable of capturing specific music style and generating novel tunes for Chinese folk songs (Min Ge) in a manipulatable way. Specifically, we disentangle the latent space of VAE into four parts in an adversarial training way to control the information of pitch and rhythm sequence, as well as of music style and content. In detail, two classifiers are used to separate style and content latent space, and temporal supervision is utilized to disentangle the pitch and rhythm sequence. The experimental results show that the disentanglement is successful and our model is able to create novel folk songs with controllable regional styles. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on applying deep generative model and adversarial training for Chinese music generation.},

We show that MIDI-VAE can perform style transfer on symbolic music by automatically changing pitches, dynamics and instruments of a music piece from, e.g., a Classical to a Jazz style. We evaluate the efficacy of the style transfer by training separate style validation classifiers. Our model can also interpolate between short pieces of music, produce medleys and create mixtures of entire songs. The interpolations smoothly change pitches, dynamics and instrumentation to create a harmonic bridge between two music pieces. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful attempt at applying neural style transfer to complete musical compositions.},

Using storytelling approaches we draw on qualitative data from a three-month study of the soma mat and breathing light in four households. We tell stories of people’s becomings in the world as they learn of new possibilities for their somas; and as their somas transform. We show how people drew on their somaesthetic experiences with the prototypes to find their way through troubled times; and how through continued engagement some felt compelled to make transformations in how they live their lives. We discuss the implications for the overarching soma design program, focusing on what is required to design for ways of leading a better life.},

Changing perceptions of both modernism and magazine culture have shattered this ideal match, reshuffling the cards and bringing to the fore a more nuanced and complex picture. Modernism, on the one hand, is no longer a monolithic whole, safely protected from all things non-modern or antimodern. Magazines, on the other hand, have stopped being reduced to the prestigious yet small territory of confidential literary avant-garde publications circulating from hand to hand with the ambition of revolutionizing culture, society, and life. Magazine scholarship is now addressing all kinds of magazines: big and small, political and commercial or otherwise made for entertainment (but no longer despised as futile), text-only and lavishly illustrated, formal and context bound.},

	abstract = {Wireless earphones are pervasive acoustic sensing platforms that can be used for many applications such as motion tracking and handwriting input. However, wireless earphones suffer clock offset between the connected smart devices, which would accumulate error rapidly over time. Moreover, compared with smartphone and voice assistants, the acoustic signal transmitted by wireless earphone is much weaker due to the poor frequency response. In this paper, we propose MagSound, which uses the built-in magnets to improve the tracking and acoustic sensing performance of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) earphones. Leveraging magnetic field strength, MagSound can predict the position of wireless earphones free from clock offset, which can be used to re-calibrate the acoustic tracking. Further, the fusion of the two modalities mitigates the accumulated clock offset and multipath effect. Besides, to increase the robustness to noise, MagSound employs finely designed Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) ranging signals. We implement a prototype of MagSound on COTS and perform experiments for tracking and handwriting input. Results demonstrate that MagSound maintains millimeter-level error in 2D tracking, and improves the handwriting recognition accuracy by 49.81\%. We believe that MagSound can contribute to practical applications of wireless earphones-based sensing.},

Nevertheless, it is challenging to theoretically frame the variety of digital or immaterial, and physical materials. In order to contribute to this materiality discourse, we reflect on McLuhan's work on media analysis and on Latour's Actor-Network Theory in this paper. Both emphasize the active role of the material - be it media or any other kind of non-human actors - in the interplay with the human. Thus, we establish junctures between their findings and materials, as used in interaction design in HCI. We discuss McLuhan's claim to focus on new sensory effects and ways of interaction brought forth by new media. Furthermore, we illustrate how describing the connections between materials, designers, and users in terms of Latour's Actor-Networks can be beneficial for interaction design. Finally, we discuss the respective methodology and its relation to research through design.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural content, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural experience. While the majority of academic and industrial research on recommender systems optimizes for personalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that recommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across populations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness studies probe how recommender systems relate to the broader social role of cultural content, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge. In this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure of recommender systems that reflects the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric responds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media (PSM) systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing pluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare the performance of recommendation algorithms using commonality and existing utility, diversity, novelty, and fairness metrics. Our results demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative, non-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening cultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing ‘public good’ rationales for digital media and machine learning systems.},

The workshop uses the notion of magic and machine as substitute for technology to allow a broader range of response. We ask questions like: How do we design magic? What is magical to you? If you could make anything at all, what would it be? The responses are low-fi objects built from paper, cardboard, wood, string and plastic. These objects are in turn treated as props in a process of enacting a future scenario-of-use. The paper describes the process itself as well as a small selection of the resulting objects and suggests some tentative guidelines for using this type of workshop format.},

The control of this and the faithfulness to an original sound has informed modern sound aesthetics. Current modes of reproduction, such as streaming, see the listener more interested in an approximate presentation of sound, rather than a broad and more psychoacoustically pleasing one. In the sonic arts, the practice of sound recycling and its associated methodologies, reproduction is re-contextualised, involving material that is borrowed, reworked and often disconnected from its source. Such issues are considered in this article through the examination of sound recycling in 94 diskont (1995), an album produced by the German act Oval. By studying the use of material and medium in the work, an attempt is made to discuss approaches to sound recycling through conceptual frameworks proposed by Bregman, Deleuze, Guattari and Smalley to provide a forum towards the interpretation of sound recycling in wider sonic arts practices.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a new method of sound transformation based on control parameters that are intuitive and relevant for musicians. This method uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) model that is first trained in an unsupervised manner on a large dataset of synthesizer sounds. Then, a perceptual regularization term is added to the loss function to be optimized, and a supervised fine-tuning of the model is carried out using a small subset of perceptually labeled sounds. The labels were obtained from a perceptual test of Verbal Attribute Magnitude Estimation in which listeners rated this training sound dataset along eight perceptual dimensions (French equivalents of metallic, warm, breathy, vibrating, percussive, resonating, evolving, aggressive). These dimensions were identified as relevant for the description of synthesizer sounds in a first Free Verbalization test. The resulting VAE model was evaluated by objective reconstruction measures and a perceptual test. Both showed that the model was able, to a certain extent, to capture the acoustic properties of most of the perceptual dimensions and to transform sound timbre along at least two of them (aggressive and vibrating) in a perceptually relevant manner. Moreover, it was able to generalize to unseen samples even though a small set of labeled sounds was used.},

	abstract = {Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) play a fundamental role in the study of creativity in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Even so, there is no consensus definition of the term 'CST' in HCI, and in most studies, CSTs have been construed as one-off exploratory prototypes, typically built by the researchers themselves. This makes it difficult to clearly demarcate CST research, but also to compare findings across studies, which impedes advancement in digital creativity as a growing field of research. Based on a literature review of 143 papers from the ACM Digital Library (1999-2018), we contribute a first overview of the key characteristics of CSTs developed by the HCI community. Moreover, we propose a tentative definition of a CST to help strengthen knowledge sharing across CST studies. We end by discussing our study's implications for future HCI research on CSTs and digital creativity.},

	abstract = {This article offers some epistemological and methodological considerations on the topic of measuring creativity across cultures. It starts from reflecting on the key terms—creativity, culture, and measurement—and continues by proposing and illustrating three different types of “logic” that can underpin the cultural study of creativity. The logic of comparison focuses on standardization and comparability and is specific for most cross-cultural investigations. The logic of exploration highlights differences in creativity assessment between people and groups and focuses on their origins and dynamic, something specific for cultural or sociocultural research. Last but not least, the logic of understanding guides those investigations that operate with local and bottom-up rather than universal, top-down definitions and categories, inspired by what is known as indigenous psychology. By reflecting on the strengths and limitations of each approach, the article ends with some theoretical and practical guidelines for those researchers interested in the study of creativity, culture and their complex, multifaceted relationship.

	abstract = {Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion tracking, eye-tracking and many other technology-based data collection methods have led to a torrent of high dimensional datasets, which commonly have a small number of samples because of the intrinsic high cost of data collection involving human participants. High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.},

	abstract = {The crisis that capitalism is going through has put the idea of alternatives to it back on the agenda. Marx himself wrote surprising little about this topic, the bulk of his work is focused on capitalism itself. From early on he came to the conclusion that communism cannot be fully established immediately upon the overthrow of capitalism, a two stage process will be necessary. In the first stage the capitalist state, which rules in the interests of capital, will be overthrown and replaced by a state which will rule on behalf of working people. This is what Marx calls the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’, and it supersedes the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie of capitalist society. It will take all private property in the means of production (i.e., capital) into common ownership, and operate it for the ‘common good’ rather than for private profit.1 But this is not ‘full’ (i.e., fully developed) or ‘true’ communism, as Marx conceives of it, it is only a transitional phase ‘between capitalism and communism’ (Marx, 1978c, 538).2 A transitional stage is necessary, Marx believed, because the new society will have just emerged from capitalism and will still embody many of its features.},

	abstract = {Falls are the leading cause of fatal injuries to elders in modern society, which has motivated researchers to propose various fall detection technologies. We observe that most of the existing fall detection solutions are diverging from the purpose of fall detection: timely alarming the family members, medical staff or first responders to save the life of the human with severe injury caused by fall. Instead, they focus on detecting the behavior of human falls, which does not necessarily mean a human is in real danger. The real critical situation is when a human cannot get up without assistance and is thus lying on the ground after the fall because of losing consciousness or becoming incapacitated due to severe injury. In this paper, we define a life-threatening fall as a behavior that involves a falling down followed by a long-lie of humans on the ground, and for the first time point out that a fall detection system should focus on detecting life-threatening falls instead of detecting any random falls. Accordingly, we design and implement LT-Fall, a mmWave-based life-threatening fall detection and alarming system. LT-Fall detects and reports both fall and fall-like behaviors in the first stage and then identifies life-threatening falls by continuously monitoring the human status after fall in the second stage. We propose a joint spatio-temporal localization technique to detect and locate the micro-motions of the human, which solves the challenge of mmWave's insufficient spatial resolution when the human is static, i.e., lying on the ground. Extensive evaluation on 15 volunteers demonstrates that compared to the state-of-the-art work (92\% precision and 94\% recall), LT-Fall achieves zero false alarms as well as a precision of 100\% and a recall of 98.8\%.},

Using audio as a uniquely intimate medium, we explore critical inquiry through context-based assemblages of seemingly disparate parts and experiences that coexist and can (re)constitute each other.

Situated in a contemporary critical, interdisciplinary framework of fetish, masculinity and sexuality studies, this research interrogates how audio technologies manufactured and intended for music production contexts become sexy. Applying a mixed-mode methodology, including an intensive discourse, image and material-semiotic analysis of an ‘epic’ sexy gear thread, we collated extensive data about technological fetishization. Sexy gear discourse articulates themes of voyeurism, acquisition, control and animation – linking the fetish value of technological objects and their connoisseurship with the erotic potential of sexualized objects. Such discourses ultimately serve to maintain social order, and become sites for performing the maintenance work of hegemonic masculine formations. This research provides new insights into how hegemonic masculinities depend upon the organization of online and ofﬂine sociability around fetishized material objects. Furthermore, our ﬁndings align with those of current scholarship focused on representational politics of technoculture.},

To establish the potential of this approach, we first establish if representations from these models encode information about manipulations. We carry out experiments and produce visualizations using representations from two different pretrained autoencoders. Our findings indicate that, while some information about audio manipulations is encoded, this information is both limited and encoded in a non-trivial way. This is supported by our attempts to visualize these representations, which demonstrated that trajectories of representations for common manipulations are typically nonlinear and content dependent, even for linear signal manipulations. As a result, it is not yet clear how these pretrained autoencoders can be used to manipulate audio signals, however, our results indicate this may be due to the lack of disentanglement with respect to common audio manipulations.},

	abstract = {Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied for many recognition problems in machine learning and computer vision. Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function very well when large number of training data is provided, the lack of probabilistic inference of the current supervised deep learning methods makes it difficult to model a complex structured output representations. In this work, we develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows a fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. In addition, we provide novel strategies to build a robust structured prediction algorithms, such as recurrent prediction network architecture, input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction training methods. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the deterministic deep neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic output representations using stochastic inference. Furthermore, the proposed schemes in training methods and architecture design were complimentary, which leads to achieve strong pixel-level object segmentation and semantic labeling performance on Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 and the subset of Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.},

In relation to the vast amount of creative content available online, an emerging community has forged a culture of sharing. Creative Commons (CC) appears as a legal framework to support such initiative enabling the reuse and remix of creative artefacts. In this chapter, we discuss key concepts and challenges related to the use of CC online audio content (Audio Commons content) for linear media production. We present five use cases connected to the Audio Commons Initiative, illustrating how the gap between audio content creators, digital content providers, sound designers and music producers can be bridged using a web infrastructure and user-friendly tools. The use cases cover various creative production workflows from composition to performance. This chapter discusses novel tools enabling users to “surf” the web in search of sounds matching a creative brief, to import and process CC-licensed audio in the DAW, or to play live performances with laptop ensembles making use of responsive web audio technologies.},

Finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges that can be approached using music information retrieval (MIR).

We present a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content from online Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR methods (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied to sounds. We demonstrate its potential through the reflection of an illustrative case study and the feedback from four expert users. The users tried the system with either a personal database or a crowdsourced database and reported its potential in facilitating tailorability of the tool to their own creative workflows.},

	abstract = {Music Inpainting is the task of ﬁlling in missing or lost information in a piece of music. We investigate this task from an interactive music creation perspective. To this end, a novel deep learning-based approach for musical score inpainting is proposed. The designed model takes both past and future musical context into account and is capable of suggesting ways to connect them in a musically meaningful manner.

Results from an extensive two-year field study of over 1,000 sequencer and tracker users, combining interaction logging, user surveys, and a video study, are used to illustrate the properties of notations and interfaces that facilitate greater immersion in musical activities and domains, borrowing concepts from programming to illustrate the role of visual and musical feedback, from the notation and domain respectively. The Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework and Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory are combined to demonstrate how non-realtime, notation-mediated interaction can support focused, immersive, energetic, and intrinsically rewarding musical experiences, and to what extent they are supported in the interfaces of music production software. Users are shown to maintain liveness through a rapid, iterative editaudition cycle that integrates audio and visual feedback.},

In 63 unacquainted dyads (81 women and 45 men), a narrator told his or her own close-call story. The listeners made 2 different kinds of listener responses: Generic responses included nodding and vocalizations such as "mhm." Specific responses, such as wincing or exclaiming, were tightly connected to (and served to illustrate) what the narrator was saying at the moment. In experimental conditions that distracted listeners from the narrative content, listeners made fewer responses, especially specific ones, and the narrators also told their stories significantly less well, particularly at what should have been the dramatic ending. Thus, listeners were co-narrators both through their own specific responses, which helped illustrate the story, and in their apparent effect on the narrator's performance. The results demonstrate the importance of moment-by-moment collaboration in face-to-face dialogue.},

	abstract = {1-systems are a mathematical formalism which was proposed by Aristid 1indenmayer in 1968 as a foundation for an axiomatic theory of develop ment. The notion promptly attracted the attention of computer scientists, who investigated 1-systems from the viewpoint of formal language theory. This theoretical line of research was pursued very actively in the seventies, resulting in over one thousand publications. A different research direction was taken in 1984 by Alvy Ray Smith, who proposed 1-systems as a tool for synthesizing realistic images of plants and pointed out the relationship between 1-systems and the concept of fractals introduced by Benoit Mandel brot. The work by Smith inspired our studies of the application of 1-systems to computer graphics. Originally, we were interested in two problems: • Can 1-systems be used as a realistic model of plant species found in nature? • Can 1-systems be applied to generate images of a wide class of fractals? It turned out that both questions had affirmative answers. Subsequently we found that 1-systems could be applied to other areas, such as the generation of tilings, reproduction of a geometric art form from East India, and synthesis of musical scores based on an interpretation of fractals. This book collects our results related to the graphical applications of- systems. It is a corrected version of the notes which we prepared for the ACM SIGGRAPH '88 course on fractals.},

This book examines questions related to music that cannot be set in conventional notation, reporting and reflecting on current research and creative practice primarily in live electronic music. It studies compositions for which the musical text is problematic, that is, non-existent, incomplete, insufficiently precise or transmitted in a nontraditional format. Thus, at the core of this project is an absence. The objects of study lack a reliably precise graphical representation of the work as the composer or the composer/performer conceived or imagined it. How do we compose, perform and study music that cannot be set in conventional notation? The authors of this book examine this problem from the complementary perspectives of the composer, the performer, the musical assistant, the audio engineer, the computer scientist and the musicologist},

The agent that makes this waste potentially hazardous is hexavalent chromium. Its compounds can have negative effects on human health and some CrVI salts are considered carcinogens. The authors present the risks of spontaneous oxidization of CrIII to CrVI in the open-air dumps as well as the possible risks of wearing bad quality shoes, in which the chromium content is not controlled. There are several ways of handling primary leather waste, but no satisfactory technology has been developed for the secondary waste (manipulation waste, e.g. leather scraps and used leather products). In this contribution, a new three-step hybrid technology of processing manipulation waste is presented and tested under laboratory, pilot-scale and industrial conditions. The ﬁltrate can be used as a good quality NPK fertilizer. The solid product, titanium–chromium sludge, can serve as an inorganic pigment in glass and ceramic industry. Further, the authors propose selective collection of used leather products (e.g. old shoes), the hydrolysable parts of which can be also processed by the new hybrid technology.},

In a more or less recent past, writers have frequently benefited from this type of financial and/ or logistic support. Bisenius-Penin’s book starts with a useful reminder of the long-standing tradition, as well as brief typology of who (which public or private sponsor) was offering what type of residency (short/long, solitary/collective, etc.) to whom (which type of writer). The starting point of this study is the observation that in France, quite surprisingly perhaps, the residency system has for several decades tended to turn into a key dimension of literary life and cultural policy in a broad sense. More and more supporting public and private bodies are choosing the residence formula to shape their support for writing and reading, while a rapidly increasing number of literary authors are making room for residency periods in their own creative and communicative practices.},

Interpretation of latent spaces is challenging because prior knowledge, sometimes subtle and implicit, is essential to the process. We contribute methods for “latent space cartography”, the process of mapping and comparing meaningful semantic dimensions within latent spaces. We ﬁrst perform a literature survey of relevant machine learning, natural language processing, and scientiﬁc research to distill common tasks and propose a workﬂow process. Next, we present an integrated visual analysis system for supporting this workﬂow, enabling users to discover, deﬁne, and verify meaningful relationships among data points, encoded within latent space dimensions. Three case studies demonstrate how users of our system can compare latent space variants in image generation, challenge existing ﬁndings on cancer transcriptomes, and assess a word embedding benchmark.},

In order to estimate this crossmodal, emotion-centric similarity, we propose a deep neural network architecture that learns to project the data from the two modalities to a common representation space, and performs a binary classification task of predicting the affective correspondence (true or false). To facilitate the current study, we construct a large scale database containing more than \$3,500\$ music clips and \$85,000\$ images with three emotion classes (positive, neutral, negative). The proposed approach achieves \$61.67{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy for the affective correspondence prediction task on this database, outperforming two relevant and competitive baselines. We also demonstrate that our network learns modality-specific representations of emotion (without explicitly being trained with emotion labels), which are useful for emotion recognition in individual modalities.},

Requiring a large number of data samples, many deep learning solutions suffer from data hunger and extensively high computation time and resources. Furthermore, data is often not available due to not only the nature of the problem or privacy concerns but also the cost of data preparation. Data collection, preprocessing, and labeling are strenuous human tasks. Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the turnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost solution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently proposed few-shot learning algorithms. Given the learning dynamics and characteristics, the approaches to few-shot learning problems are discussed in the perspectives of meta-learning, transfer learning, and hybrid approaches (i.e., different variations of the few-shot learning problem).},

Our model, the Conditional Subspace VAE (CSVAE), uses mutual information minimization to learn a low-dimensional latent subspace associated with each label that can easily be inspected and independently manipulated.

We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underﬁts WebText. Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

	abstract = {Deep generative neural networks have proven effective at both conditional and unconditional modeling of complex data distributions. Conditional generation enables interactive control, but creating new controls often requires expensive retraining. In this paper, we develop a method to condition generation without retraining the model. By post-hoc learning latent constraints, value functions that identify regions in latent space that generate outputs with desired attributes, we can conditionally sample from these regions with gradient-based optimization or amortized actor functions. Combining attribute constraints with a universal "realism" constraint, which enforces similarity to the data distribution, we generate realistic conditional images from an unconditional variational autoencoder. Further, using gradient-based optimization, we demonstrate identity-preserving transformations that make the minimal adjustment in latent space to modify the attributes of an image. Finally, with discrete sequences of musical notes, we demonstrate zero-shot conditional generation, learning latent constraints in the absence of labeled data or a differentiable reward function.

However, a creator may know a good mapping when they encounter it yet start with little sense of what the inputs or outputs should be. We call this an open-ended mapping process. Addressing this need, we introduce the latent mapping, which leverages the latent space of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm such as a Variational Autoencoder trained on a corpus of unlabelled gestural data from the creator.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: DIALECTICS The most damaging yet most common error in discussions of Brecht's theory has been to see it as fixed and unchanging, and to view it therefore as either dogmatic, communist-inspired abstraction or revered holy writ. Behind these views lie different perceptions of Marxism and the rights and wrongs of political art. Brecht began to think through the ideas with which he is most commonly associated in the late 1920s and early 1930s. His emphasis and terminology changed in these years, as well as subsequently, and many see in his later remarks and essays (especially A Short Organum for the Theatre, 1948) a belated acceptance of the conventions of realism and the realities of emotional experience suppressed by the supposed sterile intellectualism of his earlier years. In this way Brecht has often come to be admired as a great writer, particularly in the West, in spite of his theory: as at once reconciled with his own youthful hedonism and with the forms and verities of an art above theory and politics. In fact, this is simply to read Brecht in terms of one favoured aesthetic ideology rather than another, and to compromise his art and ideas as much, though in another direction, as a protective state socialism ever did.},

He has been a fixture of New York's "Downtown Scene" since the mid-70s as a tireless proponent of avant-garde and experimental music. Despite the acclaim and respect he has achieved in America and abroad, very little attention has been paid to Zorn by musicologists or music theorists. Author John Brackett suggests that the reason for the relative paucity of writing on Zorn's music and musical thought has to do with the difficulties and challenges they present both for listeners and scholars. Zorn's musical language—an amalgam of seemingly incongruous techniques, sounds, styles, and genres—creates complex and sometimes confusing listening experiences that are difficult to categorize in terms of overarching thematic or narrative design. Brackett offers a number of perspectives for understanding Zorn's music and musical practices, while challenging certain assumptions that limit the ways in which contemporary music is typically addressed.},

We extend the recent MusicVAE model to represent multitrack polyphonic measures as vectors in a latent space. Our approach enables several useful operations such as generating plausible measures from scratch, interpolating between measures in a musically meaningful way, and manipulating specific musical attributes. We also introduce chord conditioning, which allows all of these operations to be performed while keeping harmony fixed, and allows chords to be changed while maintaining musical "style". By generating a sequence of measures over a predefined chord progression, our model can produce music with convincing long-term structure. We demonstrate that our latent space model makes it possible to intuitively control and generate musical sequences with rich instrumentation (see https://goo.gl/s2N7dV for generated audio).},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746996},
	abstract = {Audio representations for music information retrieval are typically learned via supervised learning in a task-specific fashion. Although effective at producing state-of-the-art results, this scheme lacks flexibility with respect to the range of applications a model can have and requires extensively annotated datasets. In this work, we pose the question of whether it may be possible to exploit weakly aligned text as the only supervisory signal to learn general-purpose music audio representations. To address this question, we design a multimodal architecture for music and language pre-training (MuLaP) optimised via a set of proxy tasks. Weak supervision is provided in the form of noisy natural language descriptions conveying the overall musical content of the track. After pre-training, we transfer the audio backbone of the model to a set of music audio classification and regression tasks. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by comparing the performance of audio representations produced by the same audio backbone with different training strategies and show that our pre-training method consistently achieves comparable or higher scores on all tasks and datasets considered. Our experiments also confirm that MuLaP effectively leverages audio-caption pairs to learn representations that are competitive with audio-only and cross-modal self-supervised methods in the literature.},

	abstract = {With the deployment of a growing number of smart home IoT devices, privacy leakage has become a growing concern. Prior work on privacy-invasive device localization, classification, and activity identification have proven the existence of various privacy leakage risks in smart home environments. However, they only demonstrate limited threats in real world due to many impractical assumptions, such as having privileged access to the user's home network. In this paper, we identify a new end-to-end attack surface using IoTBeholder, a system that performs device localization, classification, and user activity identification. IoTBeholder can be easily run and replicated on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices such as mobile phones or personal computers, enabling attackers to infer user's habitual behaviors from smart home Wi-Fi traffic alone. We set up a testbed with 23 IoT devices for evaluation in the real world. The result shows that IoTBeholder has good device classification and device activity identification performance. In addition, IoTBeholder can infer the users' habitual behaviors and automation rules with high accuracy and interpretability. It can even accurately predict the users' future actions, highlighting a significant threat to user privacy that IoT vendors and users should highly concern.},

In fact, we estimate that over 12 million people in American workplaces would say that they "do programming" at work, and almost 50 million people use spreadsheets or databases (and therefore may potentially program), compared to only 3 million professional programmers. The "programming" systems used by these end users include spreadsheet systems, web authoring tools, business process authoring tools such as Visual Basic, graphical languages for demonstrating the desired behavior of educational simulations, and even professional languages such as Java. The motivation for end-user programming is to have the computer be useful for each person's specific individual needs. While the empirical study of programming has been an HCI topic since the beginning the field, it is only recently that there has been a focus on the End-User Programmer as a separate class from novices who are assumed to be studying to be professional programmers. Another recent focus is on making end-user programming more reliable, using "End-User Software Engineering." This paper gives a brief summary of some current and past research in the area of End-User Programming.},

	abstract = {Jean-Luc Godard (UK:  GOD-ar, US:  goh-DAR; French: [ʒɑ̃ lyk ɡɔdaʁ]; born 3 December 1930) is a French-Swiss film director, screenwriter and film critic. He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement, and is arguably the most influential French filmmaker of the post-war era. According to AllMovie, his work "revolutionized the motion picture form" through its experimentation with narrative, continuity, sound, and camerawork.During his early career as a film critic for the influential magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, Godard criticized mainstream French cinema's "Tradition of Quality", which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation. In response, he and like-minded critics began to make their own films, challenging the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema. Godard first received global acclaim for his 1960 feature Breathless, helping to establish the New Wave movement. His work makes use of frequent homages and references to film history, and often expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy. Since the New Wave, his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about representation and human conflict from a humanist, and a Marxist perspective.In a 2002 Sight \& Sound poll, Godard ranked third in the critics' top ten directors of all time (which was put together by assembling the directors of the individual films for which the critics voted). He is said to have "created one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century." He and his work have been central to narrative theory and have "challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism's vocabulary." In 2010, Godard was awarded an Academy Honorary Award, but did not attend the award ceremony. Godard's films have inspired many directors including Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Brian De Palma, Steven Soderbergh, D. A. Pennebaker, Robert Altman, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Pier Paolo Pasolini.Through his father, he is the cousin of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, former President of Peru. He has been married twice, to actresses Anna Karina and Anne Wiazemsky, both of whom starred in several of his films. His collaborations with Karina—which included such critically acclaimed films as Vivre sa vie (1962), Bande à part (1964) and Pierrot le Fou (1965)—were called "arguably the most influential body of work in the history of cinema" by Filmmaker magazine.},

	abstract = {This essay addresses the emergence of theories of “identity” in twentieth-century politics, aesthetics, and philosophy by considering Theodor Adorno's understanding of “negative identity” as a form of coercive categorization that nevertheless contains social knowledge. A historical account of the Frankfurt school's relation to questions of race, anti-Semitism, and the idea of culture, the essay analyzes Adorno's infamous jazz articles in light of the transatlantic history of Marxian political theory and its understanding of racism, subject–object relations, and models of cultural production. The result is an investigation of the history of the concept of identity, its emergence alongside the rise of cultural studies, and its relation to international cultural–aesthetic formations such as jazz. The article concludes with an examination of Adorno's critique of idealism, cultural identity, and nationalism in light of the “wounded” political subjectivity of the modern era.},

	abstract = {"Co-authored by three prominent philosophers of art, Jazz and the Philosophy of Art is the first book in English to be exclusively devoted to philosophical issues in jazz. It covers such diverse topics as minstrelsy, bebop, Voodoo, social and tap dancing, parades, phonography,musical forgeries, and jazz singing, as well as Goodman's allographic/autographic distinction, Adorno's critique of popular music, and what improvisation is and is not. The book is organized into three parts. Drawing on innovative strategies adopted to address challenges that arise for the project of defining art, Part I shows how historical definitions of art provide a blueprint for a historical definition of jazz. Part II extends the boor's commitment to social-historical contextualism by exploring distinctive ways that jazz has shaped, and been shaped by, American culture. It uses the lens of jazz vocals to provide perspective on racial issues previously unaddressed in the work. It then examines the broader premise that jazz was a socially progressive force in American popular culture. Part III concentrates on a topic that has entered into the arguments of each of the previous chapters: what is jazz improvisation? It outlines a pluralistic framework in which distinctive performance intentions distinguish distinctive kinds of jazz improvisation.This book is a comprehensive and valuable resource for any reader interested in the intersections between jazz and philosophy."--Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {"Jazz Theory: From Basic to Advanced Study, Second Edition, is a comprehensive textbook for those with no previous study in jazz, as well as those in advanced theory courses. Written with the goal to bridge theory and practice, it provides a strong theoretical foundation from music fundamentals to post-tonal theory, while integrating ear training, keyboard skills, and improvisation. It hosts "play-along" audio tracks on a Companion Website, including a workbook, ear-training exercises, and an audio compilation of the musical examples featured in the book. Jazz Theory is organized into three parts: Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced. This approach allows for success in a one-semester curriculum or with subsequent terms. If students sense that theory can facilitate their improvisational skills or can help them develop their ears, they become more engaged in the learning process. The overall pedagogical structure accomplishes precisely that in an original, creative--and above all, musical--manner. KEY FEATURES include 390 musical examples, ranging from original lead sheets of standard tunes, jazz instrumentals, transcriptions, and original compositions, to fully realized harmonic progressions, sample solos, and re- harmonized tunes. The completely revamped Companion Website hosts: 46 "Play Along Sessions" audio tracks, offering experiences close to real-time performance scenarios. Over 1,000 (audio and written) exercises covering ear training, rhythm, notation, analysis, improvisation, composition, functional keyboard, and others. Recordings of all 390 musical examples from the textbook. Links: Guide to Making Transcriptions, List of Solos to Transcribe, Selected Discography, Classification of Standard Tunes, and more. Lists of well-known standard tunes, including a comprehensive list of 999 Standard Tunes--Composers and Lyricists. NEW TO THE SECOND EDITION are instructors' tools with answer keys to written and ear -training exercises, 380 rhythmic calisthenics featuring exercises from the swing, bebop, and Latin rhythmic traditions, a new improvisation section, a set of 140 Comprehensive Keyboard exercises, plus an expanded ear- training section with 125 melodic, 50 rhythmic dictations, and 170 harmonic dictations, plus 240 written exercises, 25 composition assignments, and 110 singing exercises."-- Provided by publisher},

We demonstrate the applicability of the contextual transparency approach by using it for a well-established ADS transparency tool: nutritional labels that display specific information about an ADS. Empirically, it focuses on the profession of recruiting. Presenting data from an ongoing study about ADS use in recruiting alongside a typology of ADS nutritional labels, we suggest a nutritional label prototype for ADS-driven rankers such as LinkedIn Recruiter before closing with directions for future work.},

The most widely used tests are qualitative or only performed intermittently, motivating the need for quantitative, accurate, and unobtrusive metrics to track disease progression. Clinical studies have shown that saccade latency (an eye movement measure of reaction time) and error rate (the proportion of eye movements in the wrong direction) may be significantly affected by neurocognitive diseases. Nevertheless, how these features change over time as a disease progresses is underdeveloped due to the constrained recording setup. In this work, our goal is to first understand how these features change over time in healthy individuals. To do so, we used a mobile app to frequently and accurately measure these features outside of the clinical environment from 80 healthy participants. We analyzed their longitudinal characteristics and designed an individualized longitudinal model using a Gaussian process. With a system that can measure eye-movement features on a much finer timescale in a broader population, we acquired a better understanding of eye-movement features from healthy individuals and provided research directions in understanding whether eye-movement features can be used to track neurocognitive states.

With a point of departure taken in “the material turn” in HCI this work identifies how this has played out in our field as six interlinked approaches – from interaction design with new materials, via craft-based approaches to CHI, to notions that treats the computer as a material and the materiality of computing. This paper takes stock of our community’s reconceptualization of computing through the material turn and then advocate a return to interaction rather than a continued concern for the material status of the computer. In this paper I argue that doing so has fundamental implications for HCI design and research. By articulating a “materiality of interaction” perspective, this paper offers ways of moving forward by developing (1) A unique form-giving practice, (2) An artistic and research-driven explorative account, and (3) the growth of systematic knowledge in our field. I view this focus on the articulation of “the materiality of interaction” as an important contribution to this special issue. In particular since a focus on how interaction is increasingly realized through computational re-activation of traditional (analogue) materials, such as paper or wood, might be key for understanding emerging material experiences.},

	abstract = {Expressive sonic interaction with sound synthesizers requires the control of a continuous and high dimensional\&nbsp;space. Further, the relationship between synthesis variables and timbre of the generated sound is typically\&nbsp;complex or unknown to users. In previous works, we presented an unsupervised\&nbsp;mapping method based on\&nbsp;machine listening and machine learning techniques, which addresses these challenges by providing a low-dimensional and perceptually related timbre control space. The mapping maximizes the breadth of the explorable sonic space covered by the sound synthesizer, and minimizes possible timbre losses due to the low­-dimensional control. The mapping\&nbsp;is generated automatically by a system requiring little input from users. In\&nbsp;this paper we present an\&nbsp;improved method and\&nbsp;an optimized implementation that drastically reduce the time\&nbsp;for timbre\&nbsp;analysis and mapping computation.\&nbsp;Here we introduce the use of the extreme learning machines\&nbsp;for the regression\&nbsp;from control to timbre spaces, and an interactive approach for the analysis of the synthesizer sonic response, performed as users explore the parameters of the instrument. This work is implemented in a\&nbsp;generic and open-source tool that enables the computation of ad hoc synthesis mappings through timbre\&nbsp;spaces, facilitating and speeding up the workflow to get a customized sonic control system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the interactive construction and exploration of mappings between visual sketches and musical controls. Interactive Machine Learning (IML) allows creators to construct mappings with personalised training examples. However, when it comes to high-dimensional data such as sketches, dimensionality reduction techniques are required to extract features for the IML model. We propose using unsupervised machine learning to encode sketches into lower-dimensional latent representations, which are then used as the source for the IML model to construct sketchto-sound mappings. We build a proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrate it using two compositions and performances. We reflect on the composing processes to discuss some unique characteristics found in mappings built by this approach and how they contribute to the musical expression.},

	abstract = {Body movements play a crucial role in music performance and perception, and they do so well beyond those devoted to sound production itself. Various movements related to the performer’s emotional intentions or structural aspects of the music are also part of the performance and crucial to the listening experience. In the present study, we investigated the effect of instructed timing on such non-sound producing body movements, focusing on musicians’ body posture. We used an infrared motion-capture system to record the movements of skilled guitarists and bassists while they were playing electric guitar and electric bass, respectively. We instructed the musicians to perform under three different timing-style conditions: laid-back (behind), on-the-beat, and pushed (ahead). We also conducted short semistructured interviews to gain further insight into their movement strategies. The results show that performers generally leaned forward when instructed to play systematically slightly ahead of the pulse. We suggest that this change is related to an alteration in the performer’s experience of the feel of the music. The results support the view that musicians’ non-sound-producing body movements are not random, but integral to the performance, and that they are closely related to the music’s microrhythmic feel.},

Deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have the ability to generate a high-level representation of audio while providing a structured latent space. Despite their advantages, the interpretability of these latent spaces in terms of human perception is often limited. To address this limitation and enhance the control over timbre generation, we propose a regularized VAE-based latent space that incorporates timbre descriptors. Moreover, we suggest a more concise representation of sound by utilizing its harmonic content, in order to minimize the dimensionality of the latent space.},

	abstract = {Disability Studies (DS) approaches lie at the heart of this chapter, which concerns itself with an analysis of interactions in which people with the label of intellectual disabilities (ID) engage with social care workers. An intellectual disability, by definition, is a lifelong impairment, which involves cognitive limitations as well as difficulties with social functioning, and coping with everyday life (Emerson \& Heslop, 2010). However, the category is very broad, differentiated, and often blurred (Williams, Swift, \& Mason, 2015), and there are strong reasons for avoiding a prior impairment-related definition. In Disability Studies, the very notion of disability is critiqued and questioned, with social model adherents following Oliver (1990) in viewing disability as the product of a disabling society which fails to include disabled people. While not denying the embodied reality and impact of impairments on the individual (see Shakespeare, 2006; Shakespeare \& Watson, 2001; Thomas, 2004), this chapter is simply more interested in the way in which categories of disability emerge from particular social circumstances, contexts and interactions. In conducting the research, we have worked closely to include people with the label of ID as active participants in the research process, and we aim to explore some different ways in which this can be achieved in research about interaction.},

In this article we argue that such a conception is too limited: information systems possess the potential to support authentic communicative interaction between organizational actors in such a way as to inspire criticism, to facilitate learning, and to raise the overall level of organizational competence. To support this claim, Habermas's communicative theory is applied to information systems. In particular, the use of information systems (referred to as IS-use) is conceived as a type of social action which can be supported through the notion of rational discourse. We consider some of the forms that such support might assume, and refer to some empirical examples presented in the literature. We suggest that by applying Habermas's theory to information systems, new insights regarding the legitimation and implementation of information systems can be obtained.},

It draws from aspects of multi-player audio-only games and interactive storytelling. A user experience study of the performance shows that people are engaged with interactive content and interact and navigate within the spatial audio content using their whole body. Asymmetric audio cues, playing distinctive content for each participant, prompt verbal and non-verbal communication. The performative aspect was well-received and participants took on roles and responsibilities within their group during the experience.},

In this review, we emphasise the divide between interpretability and explainability and illustrate these two different research directions with concrete examples of the state-of-the-art.

	abstract = {Interpreting black box classifiers, such as deep networks, allows an analyst to validate a classifier before it is deployed in a high-stakes setting. A natural idea is to visualize the deep network's representations, so as to "see what the network sees". In this paper, we demonstrate that standard dimension reduction methods in this setting can yield uninformative or even misleading visualizations. Instead, we present DarkSight, which visually summarizes the predictions of a classifier in a way inspired by notion of dark knowledge. DarkSight embeds the data points into a low-dimensional space such that it is easy to compress the deep classifier into a simpler one, essentially combining model compression and dimension reduction. We compare DarkSight against t-SNE both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating that DarkSight visualizations are more informative. Our method additionally yields a new confidence measure based on dark knowledge by quantifying how unusual a given vector of predictions is.},

	abstract = {‘When asked what musical instrument they play, few computer musicians respond spontaneously with “I play the computer.” Why not?’(Wessel and Wright 2002). Actually, most computer music performers still seem shyly reluctant to consider the computer as a regular musical instrument, but nonetheless, the computer is finally reaching the point of feeling as much at home on stage as a saxophone or an electric guitar. This assimilation was boosted over the last ten years with the arrival of affordable machines powerful enough for realtime audio processing and of versatile audio software such as Max/MSP, Pure Data or SuperCollider, but live computer music is far from being a novelty; computer-based realtime music systems started in the late 1960s and early 1970s and non-digital live electronic music goes back as far as the nineteenth century.An ambitious goal for any new instrument is the potential to create a new kind of music. In that sense, baroque music cannot be imagined without the advances of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century luthiers, rock could not exist without the electric guitar, and jazz or hip-hop, without the redefinitions of the saxophone and the turntable. This chapter explores the potential of computers as musical instruments and analyses what it is that makes them so especially different from previous instruments, unveiling the novel possibilities as well as the drawbacks they entail.},

	abstract = {The purposes of this publication are: (1) to report the status of higher education equity in the United States and to identify changes over time in measures of equity; and (2) to identify policies and practices that promote and hinder progress; and to illustrate the need for increased support of policies, programs and practices that not only improve overall attainment in higher education but also create greater equity in higher education opportunity and outcomes. In recognition of the need to address inequity based on demographic characteristics other than measures of family income, the 2016 edition of this report also includes selected tables that look at differences by race/ethnicity and family socioeconomic status (SES), an index comprised of income, education, and occupation developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for use in the high school longitudinal studies. Additionally, for this 2016 edition, the authors have adjusted the Current Population Survey (CPS) data to reflect more current estimates from the high school longitudinal studies. They also describe trends in bachelor's degree attainment using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Beginning Postsecondary Study (BPS) and the NCES high school longitudinal studies that have been conducted at irregular intervals approximately once per decade since the 1970s. Throughout this trend report, data is presented on the specific Indicators as far back as comparable data warrant beginning with 1970. In addition to providing longitudinal indicators of the status of equity, this report is written to advance productive conversation about the most effective policies and practices for improving equity in higher education opportunity and outcomes. To this end, the report includes three essays that connect the indicators to some current policy debates. These include discussions about how to reduce the stratification of college choice, higher education as a human right, and recommendations for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA). Additional methodological notes and tables are appended.},

	abstract = {Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenological philosophy, developed the concept of the so-called pure transcendental consciousness. The author of the article asks whether the concept of consciousness understood this way can constitute a model for AI consciousness. It should be remembered that transcendental consciousness is the result of the use of the phenomenological method, the essence of which is referring to experience (“back to things themselves”). Therefore, one can legitimately ask whether the consciousness that AI can achieve can possess the characteristics attributed by Husserl to pure transcendental consciousness. The answer to such questions seems to be negative because AI, as created by humans, can only operate in the field of phenomena. Human intelligence, however, is capable of operating at the ontological level. In the face of difficulties in understanding the phenomenon of consciousness on a scientific basis, the question arises about the possibility of using the phenomenological concept of consciousness developed by Husserl as a starting point in analyzes aimed at answering the question about AI consciousness (The aim of the article is not to discuss in detail the contemporary state of research on consciousness. Therefore, many results currently achieved mainly in the field of neuroscience are omitted. It is just about indicating the possible application of Husserl’s transcendental concept of consciousness in research on AI consciousness).},

First, we design a novel multi-task learning approach, in which an auxiliary task can guide the network to understand human structural features. Secondly, we introduce a multi-task feature fusion method that incorporates both intra-task and inter-task attention to aggregate spatio-temporal features of the subject from a global view. Through extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate that our proposed system is able to achieve {\textasciitilde} 92\% accuracy and {\textasciitilde} 84\% IoU accuracy. We also show that the predicted semantic labels can increase the performance of two downstream tasks (pose estimation and action recognition) by {\textasciitilde} 18\% and {\textasciitilde} 6\% respectively.},

To investigate how ideas evolve through web search, we conducted an online lab study with 56 design students who engaged in a 3-week product redesign project. Through a mixed-method analysis of web search logs, surveys, and interviews, we report on the different search behaviors, strategies, challenges and four distinct patterns–Orienters, Refiners, Confirmers, and Pivoters–that illustrate how the impact of search depends on the maturity of an idea. We discuss design opportunities to enhance web search systems for ideation and pedagogical interventions to teach creators how to improve idea-centric search.},

However, for downstream tasks like semantic classification, the representations learned by VAE are less competitive than other non-latent variable models. This has led to some speculations that latent variable models may be fundamentally unsuitable for representation learning. In this work, we study what properties are required for good representations and how different VAE structure choices could affect the learned properties. We show that by using a decoder that prefers to learn local features, the remaining global features can be well captured by the latent, which significantly improves performance of a downstream classification task. We further apply the proposed model to semi-supervised learning tasks and demonstrate improvements in data efficiency.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the field of explainable AI (XAI) has produced a vast collection of algorithms, providing a useful toolbox for researchers and practitioners to build XAI applications. With the rich application opportunities, explainability is believed to have moved beyond a demand by data scientists or researchers to comprehend the models they develop, to an essential requirement for people to trust and adopt AI deployed in numerous domains. However, explainability is an inherently human-centric property and the field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research and user experience (UX) design in this area are becoming increasingly important. In this chapter, we begin with a high-level overview of the technical landscape of XAI algorithms, then selectively survey our own and other recent HCI works that take human-centered approaches to design, evaluate, and provide conceptual and methodological tools for XAI. We ask the question "what are human-centered approaches doing for XAI" and highlight three roles that they play in shaping XAI technologies by helping navigate, assess and expand the XAI toolbox: to drive technical choices by users' explainability needs, to uncover pitfalls of existing XAI methods and inform new methods, and to provide conceptual frameworks for human-compatible XAI.},

In this article we examine the ways in which computer music languages might similarly influence the aesthetic decisions of the digital music practitioner, even when those languages are designed for generality and theoretically capable of implementing any sound-producing process. We examine the basis for querying the non-neutrality of tools with a particular focus on the concept of idiomaticity: patterns of instruments or languages which are particularly easy or natural to execute in comparison to others. We then present correspondence with the developers of several major music programming languages and a survey of digital musical instrument creators examining the relationship between idiomatic patterns of the language and the characteristics of the resulting instruments and pieces. In an open-ended creative domain, asserting causal relationships is difficult and potentially inappropriate, but we find a complex interplay between language, instrument, piece and performance that suggests that the creator of the music programming language should be considered one party to a creative conversation that occurs each time a new instrument is designed.},

Understanding how these models behave, and what their output is based on, is a challenge for developers let alone non-technical end users. Design/methodology/approach The authors investigate how AI systems and their decisions ought to be explained for end users through a systematic literature review. Findings The authors’ synthesis of the literature suggests that AI system communication for end users has five high-level goals: (1) understandability, (2) trustworthiness, (3) transparency, (4) controllability and (5) fairness. The authors identified several design recommendations, such as offering personalized and on-demand explanations and focusing on the explainability of key functionalities instead of aiming to explain the whole system. There exists multiple trade-offs in AI system explanations, and there is no single best solution that fits all cases. Research limitations/implications Based on the synthesis, the authors provide a design framework for explaining AI systems to end users. The study contributes to the work on AI governance by suggesting guidelines on how to make AI systems more understandable, fair, trustworthy, controllable and transparent.

A better understanding of what model criteria are important to users can therefore inform the design of user interfaces for model evaluation as well as the choice and design of learning algorithms. We present work studying the evaluation practices of end users interactively building supervised learning systems for real-world gesture analysis problems. We examine users' model evaluation criteria, which span conventionally relevant criteria such as accuracy and cost, as well as novel criteria such as unexpectedness. We observed that users employed evaluation techniques---including cross-validation and direct, real-time evaluation---not only to make relevant judgments of algorithms' performance and interactively improve the trained models, but also to learn to provide more effective training data. Furthermore, we observed that evaluation taught users about what types of models were easy or possible to build, and users sometimes used this information to modify the learning problem definition or their plans for using the trained models in practice. We discuss the implications of these findings with regard to the role of generalization accuracy in IML, the design of new algorithms and interfaces, and the scope of potential benefits of incorporating human interaction in the design of supervised learning systems.},

This will be made possible through an innovative hybrid of physically co-present and remote network musical performance, including a transatlantic connection between San Francisco and London.},

	abstract = {In this original and trenchant work, Christina Sharpe interrogates literary, visual, cinematic, and quotidian representations of Black life that comprise what she calls the "orthography of the wake." Activating multiple registers of "wake"—the path behind a ship, keeping watch with the dead, coming to consciousness—Sharpe illustrates how Black lives are swept up and animated by the afterlives of slavery, and she delineates what survives despite such insistent violence and negation. Initiating and describing a theory and method of reading the metaphors and materiality of "the wake," "the ship," "the hold," and "the weather," Sharpe shows how the sign of the slave ship marks and haunts contemporary Black life in the diaspora and how the specter of the hold produces conditions of containment, regulation, and punishment, but also something in excess of them. In the weather, Sharpe situates anti-Blackness and white supremacy as the total climate that produces premature Black death as normative. Formulating the wake and "wake work" as sites of artistic production, resistance, consciousness, and possibility for living in diaspora, In the Wake offers a way forward.},

	abstract = {This volume collects Kant's most important ethical and anthropological writings from the 1760s, before he developed his critical philosophy. The materials presented here range from the Observations, one of Kant's most elegantly written and immediately popular texts, to the accompanying Remarks which Kant wrote in his personal copy of the Observations and which are translated here in their entirety for the first time. This edition also includes little-known essays as well as personal notes and fragments that reveal the emergence of Kant's complex philosophical ideas. Those familiar with Kant's later works will discover a Kant interested in the 'beauty' as well as the 'dignity' of humanity, in human diversity as well as the universality of morals, and in practical concerns rather than abstract philosophizing. Readers will be able to see Kant's development from the Observations through the Remarks towards the moral philosophy that eventually made him famous},

Schaeffer’s theories have had a profound influence on composers working with technology. However, they extend beyond the confines of the studio and are applicable to many areas of contemporary musical thought, such as defining an ‘instrument’ and classifying sounds. Schaeffer has also become increasingly relevant to DJs and hip-hop producers as well as sound-based media artists. This unique book is essential for anyone interested in contemporary musicology or media history.},

In this article we examine the ways in which computer music languages might similarly influence the aesthetic decisions of the digital music practitioner, even when those languages are designed for generality and theoretically capable of implementing any sound-producing process. We examine the basis for querying the non-neutrality of tools with a particular focus on the concept of idiomaticity: patterns of instruments or languages which are particularly easy or natural to execute in comparison to others. We then present correspondence with the developers of several major music programming languages and a survey of digital musical instrument creators examining the relationship between idiomatic patterns of the language and the characteristics of the resulting instruments and pieces. In an open-ended creative domain, asserting causal relationships is difficult and potentially inappropriate, but we find a complex interplay between language, instrument, piece and performance that suggests that the creator of the music programming language should be considered one party to a creative conversation that occurs each time a new instrument is designed.},

This is something we know, performing these compositions keeps the characteristics of the instruments alive and able to survive. This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique characteristics of new instruments to a more established musical identity, providing a shared understanding and a common literature to the community.},

This "purification work" demonstrates how such categories are always in flux and are redrawn even as they are kept separate. Drawing on STS analytic techniques, we demonstrate the mechanisms of such "purification work." We also describe how such category work remained invisible to us during initial data analysis, due to our own forms of latent purification, and outline the particular analytic techniques that helped lead to this discovery. We thus provide an illustrative case of how categories come to matter in HCI research and design.},

	abstract = {Currently, federated learning (FL) can enable users to collaboratively train a global model while protecting the privacy of user data, which has been applied to human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. However, in real HAR scenarios, deploying an FL system needs to consider multiple aspects, including system accuracy, fairness, robustness, and scalability. Most existing FL frameworks aim to solve specific problems while ignoring other properties. In this paper, we propose FedCHAR, a personalized FL framework with a hierarchical clustering method for robust and fair HAR, which not only improves the accuracy and the fairness of model performance by exploiting the intrinsically similar relationship between users but also enhances the robustness of the system by identifying malicious nodes through clustering in attack scenarios. In addition, to enhance the scalability of FedCHAR, we also propose FedCHAR-DC, a scalable and adaptive FL framework which is featured by dynamic clustering and adapting to the addition of new users or the evolution of datasets for realistic FL-based HAR scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of FedCHAR on seven datasets of different sizes. The results demonstrate that FedCHAR could obtain better performance on different datasets than the other five state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and fairness. We further validate that FedCHAR-DC exhibits satisfactory scalability on three large-scale datasets regardless of the number of participants.

We hypothesized that the use of an LLM as a CST might make the LLM’s users feel more creative, and even broaden the range of ideas suggested by each individual user, but also homogenize the ideas suggested by different users. We conducted a 36-participant comparative user study and found, in accordance with the homogenization hypothesis, that different users tended to produce less semantically distinct ideas with ChatGPT than with an alternative CST. Additionally, ChatGPT users generated a greater number of more detailed ideas, but felt less responsible for the ideas they generated. We discuss potential implications of these findings for users, designers, and developers of LLM-based CSTs.},

	url = {https://www.theses.fr/2023SORUS115},
	abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have offered new ways to build models addressing a wide variety of tasks through the optimization of a set of parameters based on minimizing a cost function. Amongst these techniques, probabilistic generative models have yielded impressive advances in text, image and sound generation. However, musical audio signal generation remains a challenging problem. This comes from the complexity of audio signals themselves, since a single second of raw audio spans tens of thousands of individual samples. Modeling musical signals is even more challenging as important information are structured across different time scales, from micro (e.g. timbre, transient, phase) to macro (e.g. genre, tempo, structure) information. Modeling every scale at once would require large architectures, precluding the use of resulting models in real time setups for computational complexity reasons. In this thesis, we study how a hierarchical approach to audio modeling can address the musical signal modeling task, while offering different levels of control to the user. Our main hypothesis is that extracting different representation levels of an audio signal allows to abstract the complexity of lower levels for each modeling stage. This would eventually allow the use of lightweight architectures, each modeling a single audio scale. We start by addressing raw audio modeling by proposing an audio model combining Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), yielding high-quality 48kHz neural audio synthesis, while being 20 times faster than real time on CPU. Then, we study how autoregressive models can be used to understand the temporal behavior of the representation yielded by this low-level audio model, using optional additional conditioning signals such as acoustic descriptors or tempo. Finally, we propose a method for using all the proposed models directly on audio streams, allowing their use in realtime applications that we developed during this thesis. We conclude by presenting various creative collaborations led in parallel of this work with several composers and musicians, directly integrating the current state of the proposed technologies inside musical pieces.},

	abstract = {Habermas' critical social theory has proven to be an important and useful lens in information systems research, especially in understanding the communicative potential of information systems and in conceiving alternative approaches to information systems development. As communication and engagement have become increasingly important in the context of today's information systems, his work has perhaps even greater applicability. However, concerns that it is too utopian to apply in organizational settings have led to skepticism regarding Habermas' work. Participation by all, the “ideal speech situation” and the consensus ideal are each Habermasian requirements that have sparked this criticism.However, Habermas' work has continued to grow and evolve since the Theory of Communicative Action, the basis of much IS research drawing on his work. His contributions in discourse ethics (1990, 1993) and deliberative democracy (1998) have offered us new and important theory, and have brought to light Habermas' own clarification and evolution of his original ideas.The intent of this paper is to reopen a communicative dialog about Habermas' work. After summarizing his critical social theory, we turn to addressing our two main objectives: first, to demonstrate that evolutions in Habermasian thought have renewed its empirical possibilities and, second, to show that this new understanding constructively informs future IS research. As an illustration, we sketch out the conditions for a Habermasian-inspired requirements process and show their application to a well-studied IS development model, ETHICS (Mumford, 1983). We conclude by suggesting that Habermas' theoretical ideas can no longer be dismissed as naive, but as a constant guide to critical action — as a reference point for opening up new possibilities for communicative action in IS research and activity.},

Habermas and many critical theorists caricature means-ends rationality (the ability to pick good means to ends) e.g. by wrongly depicting means-ends rationality as egocentric. This weakens Habermas’s attempt to distinguish means-ends rationality from his hugely important and influential idea of communicative rationality (roughly, the rationality of genuine discussion). I suggest that sincerity and autonomy, rather than non-egocentrism, are the key distinguishing features of communicative rationality. This shows that communicative rationality actually overlaps with means-ends rationality. Indeed, means-ends rationality is needed by critical theorists, as I exemplify by showing its use in deliberative democracy. Moreover, means-ends rationality will be present in discourse ethics, as I show with the example of moral discourse about gay marriage. My paper thus challenges decades of what Habermas and critical theorists have written on means-ends and communicative rationality, but I stay broadly true to – and hopefully improve – Habermas’s account of rationality.},

We developed a web-based sketch recognition algorithm based on Deep Neural Network (DNN), called Marcelle-Sketch, that end-users can train incrementally. We present an experimental study that investigate people's strategies and (mis)understandings in a realistic algorithm-teaching task. Our study involved 12 participants who performed individual teaching sessions using a think-aloud protocol. Our results show that participants adopted heterogeneous strategies in which variability affected the model performances. We highlighted the importance of sketch sequencing, particularly at the early stage of the teaching task. We also found that users' understanding is facilitated by simple operations on drawings, while confusions are caused by certain inherent properties of DNN. From these findings, we propose implications for design of IML systems dedicated to novices and discuss the socio-cultural aspect of this research.},

This project also was an opportunity to further examine the use of non-linearity in music through 3D scores. This project and user study included two main aspects: the creation of graphic scores and the performance of these graphic scores. The questions guiding the user study included what creative practices and techniques come about while designing a 3D graphic score with a screen-based VR system, and what performance practices emerge when performing from different vantage points while viewing a screen-based VR graphic score?},

Weheliye develops a theory of "racializing assemblages," taking race as a set of sociopolitical processes that discipline humanity into full humans, not-quite-humans, and nonhumans. This disciplining, while not biological per se, frequently depends on anchoring political hierarchies in human flesh. The work of the black feminist scholars Hortense Spillers and Sylvia Wynter is vital to Weheliye's argument. Particularly significant are their contributions to the intellectual project of black studies vis-à-vis racialization and the category of the human in western modernity. Wynter and Spillers configure black studies as an endeavor to disrupt the governing conception of humanity as synonymous with white, western man. Weheliye posits black feminist theories of modern humanity as useful correctives to the "bare life and biopolitics discourse" exemplified by the works of Giorgio Agamben and Michel Foucault, which, Weheliye contends, vastly underestimate the conceptual and political significance of race in constructions of the human. Habeas Viscus reveals the pressing need to make the insights of black studies and black feminism foundational to the study of modern humanity.},

Drawing attention to this broader set of rights, her comprehensive analysis of Hobbes's account of political disobedience reveals a unified and coherent theory of resistance that has previously gone unnoticed and undefended.

In addition, drawing upon the properties of sacredness outlined by Belk et al (1989), hard-core members experience a sacred-like lifestyle through objectification, commitment, sacrifice, mystery, and ecstasy and flow.

	title = {Hegel’s {Dialectics}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entries/hegel-dialectics/},
	abstract = {“Dialectics” is a term used to describe a method ofphilosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictoryprocess between opposing sides. Inwhat is perhaps the most classic version of “dialectics”,the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato (see entry on Plato), for instance, presented his philosophical argument as aback-and-forth dialogue or debate, generally between the character ofSocrates, on one side, and some person or group of people to whomSocrates was talking (his interlocutors), on the other. In the courseof the dialogues, Socrates’ interlocutors propose definitions ofphilosophical concepts or express views that Socrates challenges oropposes. The back-and-forth debate between opposing sides produces akind of linear progression or evolution in philosophical views orpositions: as the dialogues go along, Socrates’ interlocutorschange or refine their views in response to Socrates’ challengesand come to adopt more sophisticated views. The back-and-forthdialectic between Socrates and his interlocutors thus becomesPlato’s way of arguing against the earlier, less sophisticatedviews or positions and for the more sophisticated oneslater., “Hegel’s dialectics” refers to the particulardialectical method of argument employed by the 19th Century Germanphilosopher, G.W.F. Hegel (see entry on Hegel), which, like other “dialectical” methods, relies on acontradictory process between opposing sides. Whereas Plato’s“opposing sides” were people (Socrates and hisinterlocutors), however, what the “opposing sides” are inHegel’s work depends on the subject matter he discusses. In hiswork on logic, for instance, the “opposing sides” aredifferent definitions of logical concepts that are opposed to oneanother. In the Phenomenology of Spirit, which presentsHegel’s epistemology or philosophy of knowledge, the“opposing sides” are different definitions ofconsciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of orclaims to know. As in Plato’s dialogues, a contradictory processbetween “opposing sides” in Hegel’s dialectics leadsto a linear evolution or development from less sophisticateddefinitions or views to more sophisticated ones later. The dialecticalprocess thus constitutes Hegel’s method for arguing against theearlier, less sophisticated definitions or views and for the moresophisticated ones later. Hegel regarded this dialecticalmethod or “speculative mode of cognition” (PR §10) asthe hallmark of his philosophy, and used the same method in thePhenomenology of Spirit [PhG], as well as in all of themature works he published later—the entire Encyclopaedia ofPhilosophical Sciences (including, as its first part, the“Lesser Logic” or the Encyclopaedia Logic [EL]),the Science of Logic [SL], and the Philosophy ofRight [PR]., Note that, although Hegel acknowledged that his dialectical method waspart of a philosophical tradition stretching back to Plato, hecriticized Plato’s version of dialectics. He argued thatPlato’s dialectics deals only with limited philosophical claimsand is unable to get beyond skepticism or nothingness (SL-M55–6; SL-dG 34–5; PR, Remark to §31). According tothe logic of a traditional reductio ad absurdum argument, ifthe premises of an argument lead to a contradiction, we must concludethat the premises are false—which leaves us with no premises orwith nothing. We must then wait around for new premises to spring uparbitrarily from somewhere else, and then see whether those newpremises put us back into nothingness or emptiness once again, ifthey, too, lead to a contradiction. Because Hegel believed that reasonnecessarily generates contradictions, as we will see, he thought new premiseswill indeed produce further contradictions. As he puts the argument,then, , Hegel argues that, because Plato’s dialectics cannot get beyondarbitrariness and skepticism, it generates only approximate truths,and falls short of being a genuine science (SL-M 55–6; SL-dG34–5; PR, Remark to §31; cf. EL Remark to §81).},

With the emergence of Machine Learning (ML), platforms specifically designed for hosting and developing ML-based projects have appeared, being HUGGING FACE HUB one of the most popular ones. HUGGING FACE HUB focuses on facilitating the sharing of datasets, pre-trained ML models and applications built with them (spaces in HUGGING FACE HUB terminology). Besides, the Hub is adding more and more collaborative features, such as issues and pull requests, to facilitate the building of these artifacts within the platform itself. With over 100K repositories, and growing fast, HUGGING FACE HUB is therefore becoming a promising source of data on all aspects of ML projects and the community interactions around them. As such, we believe it is a promising source for all types of empirical studies aimed at analyzing the collaborative development and evolution of ML artifacts. Nevertheless, apart from the API provided by the platform, there are no easy-to-use solutions to collect and explore the different facets of HUGGING FACE HUB data, including the repositories, discussions and code evolution.

	abstract = {Blood glucose measurement is commonly used to screen for and monitor diabetes, a chronic condition characterized by the inability to effectively modulate blood glucose that can lead to heart disease, vision loss, and kidney failure. Early detection of prediabetes can forestall or reverse more serious illness if healthy lifestyle adjustments or medical interventions are made in a timely manner. Current diabetes screening methods require visits to a healthcare facility and use of over-the-counter glucose-testing devices (glucometers), both of which are costly or inaccessible for many populations, reducing the chances of early disease detection. We therefore developed GlucoScreen, a readerless glucose test strip that enables affordable, single-use, at-home glucose testing, leveraging the user's touchscreen cellphone for reading and displaying results. By integrating minimal, low-cost electronics with commercially available blood glucose testing strips, the GlucoScreen prototype introduces a new type of low-cost, battery-free glucose testing tool that works with any smartphone, obviating the need to purchase a separate dedicated reader. Our key innovation is using the phone's capacitive touchscreen for the readout of the minimally modified commercially available glucose test strips. In an in vitro evaluation with artificial glucose solutions, we tested GlucoScreen with five different phones and compared the findings to two common glucometers, AccuChek and True Metrix. The mean absolute error (MAE) for our GlucoScreen prototype was 4.52 mg/dl (Accu-Chek test strips) and 3.7 mg/dl (True Metrix test strips), compared to 4.98 mg/dl and 5.44 mg/dl for the AccuChek glucometer and True Metrix glucometer, respectively. In a clinical investigation with 75 patients, GlucoScreen had a MAE of 10.47 mg/dl, while the AccuChek glucometer had a 9.88 mg/dl MAE. These results indicate that GlucoScreen's performance is comparable to that of commonly available over-the-counter blood glucose testing devices. With further development and validation, GlucoScreen has the potential to facilitate large-scale and lower cost diabetes screening. This work employs GlucoScreen's smartphone-based technology for glucose testing, but it could be extended to build other readerless electrochemical assays in the future.},

	abstract = {Advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have fostered a wide spectrum of intelligent mobile applications ranging from voice assistants on smartphones to augmented reality with smart-glasses. To deliver high-quality services, these DNNs should operate on resource-constrained mobile platforms and yield consistent performance in open environments. However, DNNs are notoriously resource-intensive, and often suffer from performance degradation in real-world deployments. Existing research strives to optimize the resource-performance trade-off of DNNs by compressing the model without notably compromising its inference accuracy. Accordingly, the accuracy of these compressed DNNs is bounded by the original ones, leading to more severe accuracy drop in challenging yet common scenarios such as low-resolution, small-size, and motion-blur. In this paper, we propose to push forward the frontiers of the DNN performance-resource trade-off by introducing human intelligence as a new design dimension. To this end, we explore human-in-the-loop DNNs (H-DNNs) and their automatic performance-resource optimization. We present H-Gen, an automatic H-DNN compression framework that incorporates human participation as a new hyperparameter for accurate and efficient DNN generation. It involves novel hyperparameter formulation, metric calculation, and search strategy in the context of automatic H-DNN generation. We also propose human participation mechanisms for three common DNN architectures to showcase the feasibility of H-Gen. Extensive experiments on twelve categories of challenging samples with three common DNN structures demonstrate the superiority of H-Gen in terms of the overall trade-off between performance (accuracy, latency), and resource (storage, energy, human labour).},

In this article, we present Groove2Groove, a one-shot style transfer method for symbolic music, focusing on the case of accompaniment styles in popular music and jazz. We propose an encoder-decoder neural network for the task, along with a synthetic data generation scheme to supply it with parallel training examples. This synthetic parallel data allows us to tackle the style transfer problem using end-to-end supervised learning, employing powerful techniques used in natural language processing.

Uncertainty, repairs and acknowledgements are expressed in user behaviour in the continuous efforts of the conversational partners to maintain mutual understanding. Users change their behaviour when interacting with systems in different forms of embodiment, which affects the abilities of these interfaces to observe users’ recurrent social signals. Additionally, humans are intellectually biased towards social activity when facing anthropomorphic agents or when presented with subtle social cues. Two studies are presented in this paper examining how humans interact in a referential communication task with wizarded interfaces in different forms of embodiment. In study 1 (N = 30), we test whether humans respond the same way to agents, in different forms of embodiment and social behaviour. In study 2 (N = 44), we replicate the same task and agents but introduce conversational failures disrupting the process of grounding. Findings indicate that it is not always favourable for agents to be anthropomorphised or to communicate with non-verbal cues, as human grounding behaviours change when embodiment and failures are manipulated.},

The chapter introduces the range of physiological signals, and focus on the electromyogram (EMG), reporting muscle tension. It then presents techniques for using the EMG in music, including signal pre-processing and feature extraction, and analysis by machine learning. The chapter discusses the challenges of reproducibility and situates the EMG in a multi-modal context with other sensing modalities. The challenges EMG poses—the degrees of freedom problem and the lack of direct link between signal and resulting movement—provide the richness in the signal that cannot be gleaned from other, physical sensors. The chapter concludes by proposing gesture "power" as one low-level feature that in part represents Laban's notion of "effort" to demonstrate the potential of the EMG to capture expressive musical gesture.},

Speech with spatial content was less fluent when speakers could not gesture than when they could gesture; speech with nonspatial content was not affected by gesture condition. Preventing gesturing increased the relative frequency of nonjuncture filled pauses in speech with spatial content. Overall, effects of preventing speakers from gesturing resembled those of increasing the difficulty of lexical access by other means, except that effects of gesture restriction were specific to speech with spatial content.

	abstract = {In relation to semantics, “grounding” has (at least) two relevant meanings. “Symbol grounding” is the process of connecting symbols (e.g., words) to perception and the world. “Communicative grounding” is the process of interactively adding to common ground in dialog. Strategies for grounding in human communication include, crucially, strategies for resolving troubles caused by various kinds of miscommunication. As it happens, these two processes of grounding are closely related. As a side-effect of grounding an utterance, dialog participants (DPs) may adjust the meanings they assign to linguistic expressions, in a process of semantic coordination. Meanings of at least some expressions (e.g., concrete nouns) include perceptual aspects which enable DPs to classify entities as falling under the expression or not based on their perception of those entities. We show how perceptual grounding of symbols can be achieved in a process of interactively adding to common ground. This requires that perceptual aspects of meaning can be updated as a result of participating in linguistic interaction, thereby enabling fine-grained semantic coordination of perceptually grounded linguistic meanings. A formal semantics for low-level perceptual aspects of meaning is presented, tying these together with the logical-inferential aspects of meaning traditionally studied in formal semantics. The key idea is to model perceptual meanings as classifiers of perceptual input. This requires a framework where intensions are (a) represented independently of extensions, and (b) structured objects which can be modified as a result of learning. We use Type Theory with Records (TTR), a formal semantics framework which starts from the idea that information and meaning are founded on our ability to perceive and classify the world, that is, to perceive objects and situations as being of types. As an example of our approach, we show how a simple classifier of spatial information based on the Perceptron can be cast in TTR.},

While traditional programming environments focus on source code, we explicitly support both code and data. Gestalt allows developers to implement a classification pipeline, analyze data as it moves through that pipeline, and easily transition between implementation and analysis. An experiment shows this significantly improves the ability of developers to find and fix bugs in machine learning systems. Our discussion of Gestalt and our experimental observations provide new insight into general-purpose support for the machine learning process.},

	abstract = {Over the centuries, musical notation has evolved from a set of vague scribbles into a precise, finely-tuned system for communicating musical ideas. But can we do better? Enter graphic scores, a movement that started in the mid-20th century to experiment with the principles of musical notation and see what happened. From purposefully ambiguous scores to notating computer effects, graphic scores have found numerous uses, even if traditional notation is still the most common. For now.

In addition, to model different styles of performance for a given input score, we employ a variational auto-encoder.

In this article, we create a GiantMIDI-Piano dataset containing 10,854 unique piano solo pieces composed by 2,786 composers. The dataset is collected as follows, we extract music piece names and composer names from the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP). We search and download their corresponding audio recordings from the internet. We apply a convolutional neural network to detect piano solo pieces. Then, we transcribe those piano solo recordings to Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) ﬁles using our recently proposed high-resolution piano transcription system. Each transcribed MIDI ﬁle contains onset, offset, pitch and velocity attributes of piano notes, and onset and offset attributes of sustain pedals. GiantMIDI-Piano contains 34,504,873 transcribed notes, and contains metadata information of each music piece. To our knowledge, GiantMIDI-Piano is the largest classical piano MIDI dataset so far. We analyses the statistics of GiantMIDI-Piano including the nationalities, the number and duration of works of composers. We show the chroma, interval, trichord and tetrachord frequencies of six composers from different eras to show that GiantMIDI-Piano can be used for musical analysis. Our piano solo detection system achieves an accuracy of 89\%, and the piano note transcription achieves an onset F1 of 96.72\% evaluated on the MAESTRO dataset. GiantMIDI-Piano achieves an alignment error rate (ER) of 0.154 to the manually input MIDI ﬁles, comparing to MAESTRO with an alignment ER of 0.061 to the manually input MIDI ﬁles.

Visual representation based approaches have been explored on spectrograms for music genre classification. However, lack of quality data and augmentation techniques makes it difficult to employ deep learning techniques successfully.

We also discuss the role of Siamese Neural Networks as an analogous to GNN for learning edge similarity weights. Furthermore, we also perform visual analysis to understand the field-of-view of our model into the spectrogram based on genre labels.},

	abstract = {Countries export much of the harm created by their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because the Earth’s atmosphere intermixes globally. Yet, the extent to which this leads to inequity between GHG emitters and those impacted by the resulting climate change depends on the distribution of climate vulnerability. Here, we determine empirically the relationship between countries’ GHG emissions and their vulnerability to negative effects of climate change. In line with the results of other studies, we find an enormous global inequality where 20 of the 36 highest emitting countries are among the least vulnerable to negative impacts of future climate change. Conversely, 11 of the 17 countries with low or moderate GHG emissions, are acutely vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change. In 2010, only 28 (16\%) countries had an equitable balance between emissions and vulnerability. Moreover, future emissions scenarios show that this inequality will significantly worsen by 2030. Many countries are manifestly free riders causing others to bear a climate change burden, which acts as a disincentive for them to mitigate their emissions. It is time that this persistent and worsening climate inequity is resolved, and for the largest emitting countries to act on their commitment of common but differentiated responsibilities.},

Focusing on key thinkers in the tradition of European (and specifically German) political thought including Kant, Marx, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the Frankfurt School, it relates them back to such foundational figures as Rousseau, Aristotle, and in particular Plato. All these thinkers are considered in relation to key passages from their major works, accompanied by an explanatory commentary which seeks to follow a conceptual and imagistic thread through the labyrinth of these complex, yet fascinating, texts. This book will appeal in particular to scholars of political theory, philosophy, and German language and culture},

The paper closes with a discussion and conclusions gained from the interviews and from working with musicians in the context of using graphic notation as a bridge between improvisation and notated music. Documentation of the author’s practice and research of these methodological and aesthetical issues may be of interest to composers and musicians that work with similar techniques.

We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

In this paper, we explored the feasibility of single-finger typing on virtual QWERTY keyboards in mid-air. We first conducted a study to examine users' 3D typing behavior on different sizes of virtual keyboards. Results showed that the participants perceived the vertical projection of the lowest point on the keyboard during a tap as the target location and inferring taps based on the intersection between the finger and the keyboard was not applicable. Aiming at this challenge, we derived a novel input prediction algorithm that took the uncertainty in tap detection into a calculation as probability, and performed probabilistic decoding that could tolerate false detection. We analyzed the performance of the algorithm through a full-factorial simulation. Results showed that the SVM-based probabilistic touch detection together with a 2D elastic probabilistic decoding algorithm (elasticity = 2) could achieve the optimal top-5 accuracy of 94.2\%. In the evaluation user study, the participants reached a single-finger typing speed of 26.1 WPM with 3.2\% uncorrected word-level error rate, which was significantly better than both tap-based and gesture-based baseline techniques. Also, the proposed technique received the highest preference score from the users, proving its usability in real text entry tasks.},

The complex relations between objects and their locations, ambiguities, and variations in the real-world environment can be better described in human language, naturally governed by grammatical rules and other modalities such as audio and depth. The models learned to bridge the gap between such modalities coupled with large-scale training data facilitate contextual reasoning, generalization, and prompt capabilities at test time. These models are referred to as foundational models. The output of such models can be modified through human-provided prompts without retraining, e.g., segmenting a particular object by providing a bounding box, having interactive dialogues by asking questions about an image or video scene or manipulating the robot's behavior through language instructions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of such emerging foundational models, including typical architecture designs to combine different modalities (vision, text, audio, etc), training objectives (contrastive, generative), pre-training datasets, fine-tuning mechanisms, and the common prompting patterns; textual, visual, and heterogeneous. We discuss the open challenges and research directions for foundational models in computer vision, including difficulties in their evaluations and benchmarking, gaps in their real-world understanding, limitations of their contextual understanding, biases, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and interpretability issues. We review recent developments in this field, covering a wide range of applications of foundation models systematically and comprehensively.

This paper presents folk theories of text-to-image (T2I) models to enrich understanding of how artist communities experience creative machine learning systems. This research draws on data collected from a workshop with 15 artists from 10 countries who incorporate T2I models in their creative practice. Through reflexive thematic analysis of workshop data, we highlight artist folk theories of T2I use, harm, and harm reduction. Folk theories of use envision T2I models as an artistic medium, a mundane tool, and locate true creativity as rising above model affordances. Theories of harm articulate T2I models as harmed by engineering efforts to eliminate glitches and product policy efforts to limit functionality. Theories of harm-reduction orient towards protecting T2I models for creative practice through transparency and distributed governance. We examine how these theories relate, and conclude by discussing how folk theorization informs responsible AI efforts.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of synthesizing high-quality facial images. Despite their success, GANs do not provide any information about the relationship between the input vectors and the generated images. Currently, facial GANs are trained on imbalanced datasets, which generate less diverse images. For example, more than 77\% of 100K images that we randomly synthesized using the StyleGAN3 are classified as Happy, and only around 3\% are Angry. The problem even becomes worse when a mixture of facial attributes is desired: less than 1\% of the generated samples are Angry Woman, and only around 2\% are Happy Black. To address these problems, this paper proposes a framework, called GANalyzer, for the analysis, and manipulation of the latent space of well-trained GANs. GANalyzer consists of a set of transformation functions designed to manipulate latent vectors for a specific facial attribute such as facial Expression, Age, Gender, and Race. We analyze facial attribute entanglement in the latent space of GANs and apply the proposed transformation for editing the disentangled facial attributes. Our experimental results demonstrate the strength of GANalyzer in editing facial attributes and generating any desired faces. We also create and release a balanced photo-realistic human face dataset.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1805.08501},
	abstract = {Timbre spaces have been used in music perception to study the perceptual relationships between instruments based on dissimilarity ratings. However, these spaces do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. In parallel, generative models have aimed to provide methods for synthesizing novel timbres. However, these systems do not provide an understanding of their inner workings and are usually not related to any perceptually relevant information. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can alleviate all of these limitations by constructing generative timbre spaces. To do so, we adapt VAEs to learn an audio latent space, while using perceptual ratings from timbre studies to regularize the organization of this space. The resulting space allows us to analyze novel instruments, while being able to synthesize audio from any point of this space. We introduce a specific regularization allowing to enforce any given similarity distances onto these spaces. We show that the resulting space provide almost similar distance relationships as timbre spaces. We evaluate several spectral transforms and show that the Non-Stationary Gabor Transform (NSGT) provides the highest correlation to timbre spaces and the best quality of synthesis. Furthermore, we show that these spaces can generalize to novel instruments and can generate any path between instruments to understand their timbre relationships. As these spaces are continuous, we study how audio descriptors behave along the latent dimensions. We show that even though descriptors have an overall non-linear topology, they follow a locally smooth evolution. Based on this, we introduce a method for descriptor-based synthesis and show that we can control the descriptors of an instrument while keeping its timbre structure.},

	abstract = {Studies on relationships between music and architecture, inherent in the Renaissance theory of proportions, have focused primarily on comparing length-to-width floor plan ratios to frequency ratios of musical intervals. But since architecture is a volumetric entity, its geometric definition involves three dimensions. Both Alberti and Palladio, in addition to their prescriptions for horizontal dimensional ratios, gave elaborate instructions for determining proportional dimensions of heights of spaces. The length-to-height-to-width proportions resulting from these recommendations, in particular those of Palladio, show striking parallels to frequency ratios of the majority of chords in the system of tonal harmony. Works of architecture, in which spaces are aligned orthogonally, may thus be compared to musical works based on a single tonality, while those, where spaces intersect at several angles, to polytonal compositions, where chords belonging to several tonalities sound simultaneously.},

	abstract = {We explore the connection between complex systems and music by studying diﬀerent approaches for generating music based on a ﬂocking system. By developing software that links the dynamics of a standard ﬂocking algorithm to a set of sound wave generators and to a musical score, we study how each approach reﬂects sonically the transition to collective order and which produces musically interesting results. First, we consider three qualitatively diﬀerent ways to translate the ﬂocking dynamics into music: (1) A direct approach that maps agent positions to sounds, (2) a synchronization approach where each agent has an oscillator that couples to neighboring agents, and (3) a physics-inspired approach that mimics the sound that would result from an eﬀective friction between neighboring agents. We then discuss Ritmos Circadianos, a musical composition for a robot orchestra that is generated entirely from ﬂocking dynamics in real-time, as an actual application of the proposed mapping algorithms. We ﬁnd that all approaches allow the listener to discriminate between the ordered and disordered states of the ﬂocking system and that the second and third approaches are particularly well-suited for generating musically interesting and appealing results.},

Four contrasting case studies from a variety of musical cultures are analysed: Dutch folk song research, reconstructive performance of rural Russian traditions, contemporary performance and composition of Persian classical music, and recreational use of a personal world music collection. We propose semantic models describing the respective domains and examine the applications of the Music Ontology for these case studies: which concepts can be successfully reused, where they need adjustments, and which parts of the reality in these case studies are not covered by the Music Ontology. The variety of traditions, contexts and modelling goals covered by our case studies sheds light on the generality of the Music Ontology and on the limits of generalisation “for all musics” that could be aspired for on the Semantic Web.},

Although only six years apart, the difference in tone is stark: the former is a methodological treatise, the latter a call to arms. What accounts for the radical shift in Foucault's approach? Foucault's time in Tunisia had been a political awakening for him, and he returned to a France much changed by the turmoil of 1968. He taught at the experimental University of Vincennes and then moved to a prestigious position at the Collège de France. He quickly became involved in activist work concerning prisons and health issues such as abortion rights, and in his seminars he built research teams to conduct collaborative work, often around issues related to his lectures and activism. Foucault: The Birth of Power makes use of a range of archival material, including newly available documents at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, to provide a detailed intellectual history of Foucault as writer, researcher, lecturer and activist. Through a careful reconstruction of Foucault's work and preoccupations, Elden shows that, while Discipline and Punish may be the major published output of this period, it rests on a much wider range of concerns and projects.},

	abstract = {CR: The New Centennial Review 3.2 (2003) 287-302 , In our time, the USAF archaeologists surmise, imperial racism has denied black subjects the right to belong to the enlightenment project, thus creating an urgent need to demonstrate a substantive historical presence. This desire has overdetermined Black Atlantic intellectual culture for several centuries. [End Page 287], To establish the historical character of black culture, to bring Africa and its subjects into history denied by Hegel et al., it has been necessary to assemble countermemories that contest the colonial archive, thereby situating the collective trauma of slavery as the founding moment of modernity., In an interview with critic Paul Gilroy in his 1991 anthology Small Acts, novelist Toni Morrison argued that the African subjects that experienced capture, theft, abduction, mutilation, and slavery were the first moderns. They underwent real conditions of existential homelessness, alienation, dislocation, and dehumanization that philosophers like Nietzsche would later define as quintessentially modern. Instead of civilizing African subjects, the forced dislocation and commodification that constituted the Middle Passage meant that modernity was rendered forever suspect., Ongoing disputes over reparation indicate that these traumas continue to shape the contemporary era. It is never a matter of forgetting what it took so long to remember. Rather, the vigilance that is necessary to indict imperial modernity must be extended into the field of the future., Because the practice of countermemory defined itself as an ethical commitment to history, the dead, and the forgotten, the manufacture of conceptual tools that could analyze and assemble counterfutures was understood as an unethical dereliction of duty. Futurological analysis was looked upon with suspicion, wariness, and hostility. Such attitudes dominated the academy throughout the 1980s., For African artists, there were good reasons for disenchantment with futurism. When Nkrumah was deposed in Ghana in 1966, it signalled the collapse of the first attempt to build the USAF. The combination of colonial revenge and popular discontent created sustained hostility towards the planned utopias of African socialism. For the rest of the century, African intellectuals adopted variations of the position that Homi Bhabha (1992) [End Page 288] termed "melancholia in revolt." This fatigue with futurity carried through to Black Atlantic cultural activists, who, little by little, ceased to participate in the process of building futures., Fast forward to the early twenty-first century. A cultural moment when digitopian futures are routinely invoked to hide the present in all its unhappiness. In this context, inquiry into production of futures becomes fundamental, rather than trivial. The field of Afrofuturism does not seek to deny the tradition of countermemory. Rather, it aims to extend that tradition by reorienting the intercultural vectors of Black Atlantic temporality towards the proleptic as much as the retrospective., It is clear that power now operates...},

In the context of an earlier re-evaluation of the role of E. B.

In developing his argument against racial mental differences, Boas proceeded by showing that the behavior of all men, regardless of race or cultural stage, was determined by a traditional body of habitual behavior patterns passed on through what we would now call enculturative processes and buttressed by ethically tainted secondary rationalizations. The behavioral significance of the older humanist-evolutionist idea of culture was thus inverted, and the basis laid for the notion of culture as a primary determinant of behavior.},

We evaluate FocalPoint against a baseline direct manipulation technique in a 12-participant study with two tasks: selecting a 3 mm wide target from a pile of cubes and virtually decorating a house with LEGO pieces.

	abstract = {Smartphones contain thermistors that ordinarily monitor the temperature of the device’s internal components; however, these sensors are also sensitive to warm entities in contact with the device, presenting opportunities for measuring human body temperature and detecting fevers. We present FeverPhone — a smartphone app that estimates a person’s core body temperature by having the user place the capacitive touchscreen of the phone against their forehead. During the assessment, the phone logs the temperature sensed by a thermistor and the raw capacitance sensed by the touchscreen to capture features describing the rate of heat transfer from the body to the device. These features are then used in a machine learning model to infer the user’s core body temperature. We validate FeverPhone through both a lab simulation with a skin-like controllable heat source and a clinical study with real patients. We found that FeverPhone’s temperature estimates are comparable to commercial off-the-shelf peripheral and tympanic thermometers. In a clinical study with 37 participants, FeverPhone readings achieved a mean absolute error of 0.229 °C, a limit of agreement of ±0.731 °C, and a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.763. Using these results for fever classification results in a sensitivity of 0.813 and a specificity of 0.904.

	abstract = {Any two objects in contact with each other exert a force that could be simply due to gravity or mechanical contact, such as any ubiquitous object exerting weight on a platform or the contact between two bones at our knee joints. The most ideal way of capturing these contact forces is to have a flexible force sensor which can conform well to the contact surface. Further, the sensor should be thin enough to not affect the contact physics between the two objects. In this paper, we showcase the design of such thin, flexible sticker-like force sensors dubbed as ‘ForceStickers’, ushering into a new era of miniaturized force sensors. ForceSticker achieves this miniaturization by creating new class of capacitive force sensors which avoid both batteries, as well as wires. The wireless and batteryless readout is enabled via hybrid analog-digital backscatter, by piggybacking analog sensor data onto a digitally identified RFID link. Hence, ForceSticker finds natural applications in space and battery-constraint in-vivo usecases, like force-sensor backed orthopaedic implants, surgical robots. Further, ForceSticker finds applications in ubiquiti-constraint scenarios. For example, these force-stickers enable cheap, digitally readable barcodes that can provide weight information, with possible usecases in warehouse integrity checks. To meet these varied application scenarios, we showcase the general framework behind design of ForceSticker. With ForceSticker framework, we design 4mm*2mm sensor prototypes, with two different polymer layers of ecoflex and neoprene rubber, having force ranges of 0-6N and 0-40N respectively, with readout errors of 0.25, 1.6 N error each ({\textless}5\% of max. force). Further, we stress test ForceSticker by {\textgreater}10,000 force applications without significant error degradation. We also showcase two case-studies onto the possible applications of ForceSticker: sensing forces from a toy knee-joint model and integrity checks of warehouse packaging.

In this work, we introduce a few-shot continual learning framework for audio classiﬁcation, where we can continuously expand a trained base classiﬁer to recognize novel classes based on only few labeled data at inference time. This enables fast and interactive model updates by end-users with minimal human effort. To do so, we leverage the dynamic few-shot learning technique and adapt it to a challenging multi-label audio classiﬁcation scenario. We incorporate a recent state-of-the-art audio feature extraction model as a backbone and perform a comparative analysis of our approach on two popular audio datasets (ESC-50 and AudioSet). We conduct an in-depth evaluation to illustrate the complexities of the problem and show that, while there is still room for improvement, our method outperforms three baselines on novel class detection while maintaining its performance on base classes.},

	abstract = {The rise of Big Data and data science has prompted a focus on data as an essential component of making and innovating data-based services. Traditionally, however, digital data has not been object to co-design as have other physical or functional dimensions of IT application design. This is problematic, because it hinders domain experts who are not IT professionals from taking part in the discussions and design of the data-based services they use and provide. We argue that to address this challenge, it is necessary to empower such domain experts to be able to consider data as an object of design, so they may contribute their expertise to the design of data-based services and their underlying data structures. This paper describes how data may be foregrounded as an explicit element of design that support domain experts’ understanding of data as something that can be designed. We present a detailed interaction analysis of video recordings of three collaborative design workshops, in which we propose a form of data notation and two data representations. We find that data may become an object of design for domain experts when tangible and flexible representations of data are used. Based on our findings, we discuss five lessons learned for foregrounding data in co-design. Together, these provide practical insights for future work.},

With both the undergraduate and graduate student in mind, the text weaves together past and present, bringing together important ideas about Irish music from a variety of sources and presenting them, in three parts, within interdisciplinary lenses of history, film, politics, poetry, and art:
I. Irish Music in Place and Time provides an overview of the island’s musical history and its relationship to current performance practice.
II. Music Traditions Abroad and at Home contrasts the instrumental and vocal musics of the "Celtic Nations" (Scotland, Wales, Brittany, etc.) and the United States with those of Ireland.
III. Focusing In: Vocal Music in Irish-Gaelic and English identifies the great songs of Ireland’s two main languages and explores the globalization of Irish music.
New to this edition are discussions of those contemporary issues reflective of Ireland’s dramatic political and cultural shifts in the decade since first publication, issues concerning equity and inclusion, white nationalism, the Irish Traveller community, hip hop and punk, and more. Pedagogical features—such as discussion questions, a glossary, a timeline of key dates, and expanded references, as well as an online soundtrack—ensure that readers of Focus: Irish Traditional Music, Second Edition will be able to grasp Ireland's important social and cultural contexts and apply that understanding to traditional and contemporary vocal and instrumental music today.},

This article reviews research methods studying real-time decision-making and discusses the implications of a previous study using RVPwSAR to observe decision-making strategies during musical improvisation. The objective of this article is twofold: (1) to present the contributions and limitations of the RVPwSAR to arrive at a better understanding of the strategies implemented in real-time during musical improvisation; (2) to discuss the potential of the RVPwSAR for studying the strategies implemented in other real-time musical creative tasks. I argue that research where the RVPwSAR is applied may contribute to a better understanding of the strategies used during the real-time musical process, and, ultimately, contribute to the promotion of creative musical teaching and learning.},

However, with the advent of digital tools such as virtual instruments and digital audio workstations, more and more creative work is digital and decoupled from the creator’s environment. Virtual Reality technologies open up new possibilities here, as creative tools can seamlessly merge with any virtual environment the user finds himself in. This paper reports on the human-centered design process of a VR application that aims at supporting the user’s individual needs to support their creativity while composing percussive beats in virtual environments. For this purpose, we derived factors that influence creativity from literature and conducted focus group interviews in order to learn how virtual environments and 3DUI can be designed for creativity support. In a subsequent laboratory study, we let users interact with a virtual step sequencer UI in virtual environments that were either customizable or fixed/unchangeable. By analyzing post-test ratings from music experts, self-report questionnaires, and user behavior data, we examined the effects of such customizable virtual environments on user creativity, user experience, flow, and subjective creativity support scales. While we did not observe a significant impact of this independent variable on user creativity, user experience or flow, we found that users had specific individual needs regarding their virtual surroundings and strongly preferred customizable virtual environments, even though the fixed virtual environment was designed to be creatively stimulating. We also observed consistently high flow and user experience ratings, which promote human-centered design of VR-based creativity support tools in a musical context.},

	abstract = {Critical social research in information systems has been gaining prominence for some time and is increasingly viewed as a valid research approach. One problem with the critical tradition is a lack of empirical research. A contributing factor to this gap in the literature is the lack of agreement on what constitutes appropriate methodologies for critical research. The present paper contributes to this debate by exploring the role that focus group research can play in the critical approach. This paper outlines the main characteristics of critical research with an emphasis on its emancipatory faculties. It then reviews the focus group method from the perspective of critical approach and provides a critical account of two research projects that used focus groups as a method of data collection. The paper presents the argument that focus groups, if designed and executed in light of a critical approach, can contribute to the emancipation of researchers and respondents. This argument is built upon the critical theories of the two most influential theorists in critical social information systems research, namely Jürgen Habermas and Michel Foucault. Critically oriented focus groups have the potential to improve communication and move real discourses closer to Habermas's ideal speech situation. At the same time, they can contribute to challenging the prevailing orthodoxy and thereby overcome established regimes of truth in the Foucauldian tradition. The paper ends by developing a set of guiding questions that provide a means for researchers to ensure that the emancipatory potential of focus group research can be achieved.},

The transition probabilities of the Markov chain are learned from the musical sequences from which the patterns were extracted. These transitions determine which of the extracted patterns can follow other patterns. Our pattern matching phase considers three dimensions: time, pitch, and duration. Patterns of notes are considered to be equivalent under shifts in time, the baseline note of the pattern, and multiplicative changes of duration across all notes in the pattern. We give experimental results using classical music as training sequences to show the viability of our method in composing novel musical sequences.},

For instance, it should not be the case that explanations associated with instances belonging to, e.g., women, are less accurate than those associated with other genders. In this work, we initiate the study of identifying group-based disparities in explanation quality. To this end, we first outline several key properties that contribute to explanation quality-namely, fidelity (accuracy), stability, consistency, and sparsity-and discuss why and how disparities in these properties can be particularly problematic. We then propose an evaluation framework which can quantitatively measure disparities in the quality of explanations. Using this framework, we carry out an empirical analysis with three datasets, six post hoc explanation methods, and different model classes to understand if and when group-based disparities in explanation quality arise. Our results indicate that such disparities are more likely to occur when the models being explained are complex and non-linear. We also observe that certain post hoc explanation methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP) are more likely to exhibit disparities. Our work sheds light on previously unexplored ways in which explanation methods may introduce unfairness in real world decision making.},

Because interaction with sound may be task oriented or experience-based it is important to understand the nature of action-sound relationships in order to design rich sonic interactions. We propose a participatory approach to sonic interaction design that first considers the affordances of sounds in order to imagine embodied interaction, and based on this, generates interaction models for interaction designers wishing to work with sound. We describe a series of workshops, called Form Follows Sound, where participants ideate imagined sonic interactions, and then realize working interactive sound prototypes. We introduce the Sonic Incident technique, as a way to recall memorable sound experiences. We identified three interaction models for sonic interaction design: conducting; manipulating; substituting. These three interaction models offer interaction designers and developers a framework on which they can build richer sonic interactions.},

	abstract = {We introduce the study of fairness in multi-armed bandit problems. Our fairness definition demands that, given a pool of applicants, a worse applicant is never favored over a better one, despite a learning algorithm’s uncertainty over the true payoffs. In the classic stochastic bandits problem we provide a provably fair algorithm based on “chained” confidence intervals, and prove a cumulative regret bound with a cubic dependence on the number of arms. We further show that any fair algorithm must have such a dependence, providing a strong separation between fair and unfair learning that extends to the general contextual case. In the general contextual case, we prove a tight connection between fairness and the KWIK (Knows What It Knows) learning model: a KWIK algorithm for a class of functions can be transformed into a provably fair contextual bandit algorithm and vice versa. This tight connection allows us to provide a provably fair algorithm for the linear contextual bandit problem with a polynomial dependence on the dimension, and to show (for a different class of functions) a worst-case exponential gap in regret between fair and non-fair learning algorithms.},

The structure and methodology used in the proposed course are oriented to the design and implementation of an fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum analyzer. This application covers most topics included in a DSP course and gives better results that those obtained with typical courses performing independent multiple simple experiments. The project is divided into modules that show specific learning necessities and determine the course contents and organization. Each laboratory part is dedicated to design and implements the block of the analyzer related to the theoretical content presented in the class. At the end of the course the students have designed all the pieces in the DSP project and have completed and verified the system. The used methodology enables students and engineers to understand and develop complex fixed-point applications, looking for the best signal processing algorithms on hardware implementations, and also results in more motivated and active students.},

	abstract = {\&quot;Absolutely essential reading.\&quot; — The Wire One of modern music\&\#39;s towering figures, composer and multi-instrumentalist Anthony Braxton has redefined critical concepts of jazz and the wider world of creative music. The Chicago native\&\#39;s works range from an early piece for 100 tubas to proposed compositions for orchestras on different planets. A modern classic, Forces in Motion follows Braxton\&\#39;s lauded quartet on a 1985 tour of England, noting his opinions of his musical predecessors — including Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Karlheinz Stockhausen — as well as his thoughts on racism and poverty. For this new 30th anniversary edition, Graham Lock provides a new chapter, detailing later encounters with Braxton and the quartet; Anthony Braxton has penned a new Afterword as well. In addition to inside views of the mind of a musical visionary, this book offers an entertaining chronicle of a touring band. Braxton\&\#39;s subjects run the gamut from chess and hamburgers to astrology, feminism, and ancient Egypt. Above all, it offers a captivating view of the frustrations and rewards that result from an artist\&\#39;s dedication of his life to creative music. \&quot;This book should be required reading for anyone interested in my music,\&quot; Anthony Braxton has observed. \&quot;Graham Lock writes from the perceptual plane of insight and dedication — coupled with a keen wit and a dynamic intellect. This is serious writing and thinking. I could not have been more fortunate.\&quot;},

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the very ability to open the black-box is increasingly limited. Especially when it comes to non-technical end-users. In this paper, we challenge the assumption of “opening” the black-box in the LLM era and argue for a shift in our XAI expectations. Highlighting the epistemic blind spots of an algorithm-centered XAI view, we argue that a human-centered perspective can be a path forward. We operationalize the argument by synthesizing XAI research along three dimensions: explainability outside the black-box, explainability around the edges of the black box, and explainability that leverages infrastructural seams. We conclude with takeaways that reflexively inform XAI as a domain.},

	abstract = {The first conversation between clinician and family is a complex, crucial encounter. This practice-based research used video recordings of my first conversations with children and families attending a specialist child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHs) for people who had already been given, or who sought, a diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Condition, to examine systemically informed practice. The objectives of the research were to explore: what happens when I subject my everyday practice to systematic research, how I move with my words and my body between different domains of action in conversation with families, and how moment-to-moment interactions with words and body contribute to the unfolding of the conversation. Working from an onto-epistemological position of knowing-in-being, I used ethnographically and auto-ethnographically inspired methods of creating material, and used multiple analyses with videos of 10 first conversations. Reflexive Thematic Analysis of transcripts was used to explore patterns across the material. I created ten themes, grouped under three thematic territories: creating a space for all voices; talking about the presenting concern; therapist as an active conductor. These thematic territories serve as a systemic processual guide to the first session. Within the themes identified, the use of tailored self-stories to build the therapeutic relationship was particularly striking. Experimental analysis to picture the flow of conversation through domains of action highlighted a unique and fluid path of actions through each conversation. This demonstrates how the flow of the conversation is jointly, responsively constructed and how the themes of the conversation are performed in an improvisational way. Applied Video Conversation Analysis together with a Systemic-Diffractive analysis demonstrated the responsive complexity of moment-to-moment actions and how epistemic status and stance are navigated, particularly in creating space for the young person to share their knowledge and understanding about matters of concern. I conclude that the overall conduct of a systemically-informed first conversation is based on a process of responsive pivoting improvisation, whereby the conversation is patterned in an improvisationally fluid, intra-active and relationally-responsive way. My findings have tentative implications for how clinicians might help families know more about what to expect when they come to CAMHs. My findings also have tentative implications for the practice and training and supervision of systemically-influenced practitioners, whereby the microanalytic techniques of applied conversation analysis can be combined with a systemic diffractive analysis to notice and improve practice. Keywords: CAMHs, first sessions, applied video conversation analysis, reflexive thematic analysis, flow mapping, autism spectrum condition, systemic practice, diffraction.},

Researchers have made inroads in this area, but their novel energy harvesting materials and fabrication techniques remain inaccessible to the general maker communities. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a toolkit that makes energy harvesting accessible to novices. In Study 1, we investigate the challenges and opportunities associated with devising energy harvesting technology with experienced researchers and makers (N=9). Using the lessons learned from this investigation, we design a wind energy harvesting toolkit, Exergy, in Study 2. It consists of a simulator, hardware tools, a software example, and ideation cards. We apply it to vehicle environments, which have yet to be explored despite their potential. In Study 3, we conduct a two-phase workshop: hands-on experience and ideation sessions. The results show that novices (N=23) could use Exergy confidently and invent self-sustainable energy harvesting applications creatively.},

Yet, tutorials struggle to convey tacit knowledge, a type of knowledge that practitioners internalize over time and experience. The subconscious nature of tacit knowledge often causes experienced practitioners to inadvertently omit fundamental actions in their instructions, which poses significant challenges for novices attempting to grasp the basics. However, no two novices are alike, making it challenging and burdensome for the tutorial author to align their tutorials with the audiences’ expertise. My doctoral research aims to create a more bespoke learning experience where tutorials are adapted to learners’ experiences without burdening the tutorial author. My contributions towards this goal include a tutorial concept extraction method that identifies the core vocabulary of a practice to inform authors of their audiences’ language, a typology that aids authors to identify key characteristics of tacit knowledge to enable richer instructions, and a framework that enables authors to use the tutorial medium effectively to maximize tacit knowledge transfer. I am currently working towards a tutorial authoring tool that leverages large language models to extract a learner’s unique and relevant experiences to create a personal knowledge inventory. Future work would combine this inventory with previous contributions to augment tutorials to be experiential, or aligned with learners’ experiences.},

Our observations let us derive a set of factors that capture practitioners’ perceived roles, challenges, benefits, and interaction patterns when creating with GenAI. From these factors, we offer insights and propose design opportunities and priorities that serve to encourage reflection from the wider community of Creativity Support Tools and GenAI stakeholders such as systems creators, researchers, and educators on how to develop systems that meet the needs of creatives in human-centered ways.},

In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a new model-agnostic mechanism to black-box model explainability. Our approach can be utilised to explain the predictions of any black-box machine learning model. Our work uses interpretable surrogate models (e.g. a decision tree) to extract global rules to describe the preditions of a model. We develop an optimization procedure, which helps a decision tree to mimic a black-box model, by efficiently retraining the decision tree in a sequential manner, using the data labeled by the black-box model. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed framework using three applications: two classification models, one built using iris dataset, other using synthetic dataset and a regression model built for bike sharing dataset.},

The field of explainable AI (XAI) seeks to make complex and opaque AI models such as neural networks more understandable to people. One approach to making generative AI models more understandable is to impose a small number of semantically meaningful attributes on generative AI models. This paper contributes a systematic examination of the impact that different combinations of variational auto-encoder models (measureVAE and adversarialVAE), configurations of latent space in the AI model (from 4 to 256 latent dimensions), and training datasets (Irish folk, Turkish folk, classical, and pop) have on music generation performance when 2 or 4 meaningful musical attributes are imposed on the generative model. To date, there have been no systematic comparisons of such models at this level of combinatorial detail. Our findings show that measureVAE has better reconstruction performance than adversarialVAE which has better musical attribute independence. Results demonstrate that measureVAE was able to generate music across music genres with interpretable musical dimensions of control, and performs best with low complexity music such as pop and rock. We recommend that a 32 or 64 latent dimensional space is optimal for 4 regularised dimensions when using measureVAE to generate music across genres. Our results are the first detailed comparisons of configurations of state-of-the-art generative AI models for music and can be used to help select and configure AI models, musical features, and datasets for more understandable generation of music.},

However, discrete latent spaces need to be sufficiently large to capture the complexities of real-world data, rendering downstream tasks computationally challenging. For instance, performing motion planning in a high-dimensional latent representation of the environment could be intractable. We consider the problem of sparsifying the discrete latent space of a trained conditional variational autoencoder, while preserving its learned multimodality. As a post hoc latent space reduction technique, we use evidential theory to identify the latent classes that receive direct evidence from a particular input condition and filter out those that do not. Experiments on diverse tasks, such as image generation and human behavior prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique at reducing the discrete latent sample space size of a model while maintaining its learned multimodality.},

We present a case study of five micro-phenomenological interviews conducted with musicians about their experiences with existing digital musical instruments. The interviews reveal deep, clear descriptions of different modalities of synchronic moments in interaction, especially in tactile connections and bodily sensations.

	abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a significant area of research, with diverse applications across various fields. In the realm of arts, the application and implications of XAI remain largely unexplored. This paper investigates how artist-researchers address and navigate explainability in their systems during creative AI/ML practices, focusing on music performance. We present two case studies: live coding of AI/ML models and sound spatialisation performance. In the first case, we explore the inherent explainability in live coding and how the integration of interactive and on-the-fly machine learning processes can enhance this explainability. In the second case, we investigate how sound spatialisation can serve as a powerful tool for understanding and navigating the latent dimensions of autoencoders. Our autoethnographic reflections reveal the complexities and nuances of applying XAI in the arts, and underscore the need for further research in this area. We conclude that the exploration of XAI in the arts, particularly in music performance, opens up new avenues for understanding and improving the interaction between artists and AI/ML systems.

The hypothesis is that art can mediate between computer code and human comprehension to overcome the limitations of explanations in and for AI systems. Artists can make the boundaries of systems visible and offer novel ways to make the reasoning of AI transparent and decipherable. Beyond this, artistic practice can explore new conﬁgurations of humans and algorithms, mapping the terrain of inter-agencies between people and machines.

We performed a statistical analysis of the muscle activation data (EMG) and audio recordings from the experiment. Then we trained a long short-term memory network with nine different configurations to map EMG signal to sound. We found that the preliminary models were able to predict audio energy features of free improvisations on the guitar, based on the dataset of raw EMG from the basic soundproducing actions. The results provide evidence of similarities between body motion and sound in music performance, compatible with embodied music cognition theories.

Many state-of-the-art methods provide explanations that mostly target the needs of AI engineers. However, there is very little work on providing explanations that support the needs of business owners, software developers, and consumers who all play significant roles in the service development and use cycle. By considering the overall context in which an explanation is presented, including the role played by the human-in-the-loop, we can hope to craft effective explanations. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the “cognitive value” of an explanation and describe its role in providing effective explanations within a given context. Specifically, we consider the scenario of a business owner seeking to improve sales of their product, and compare explanations provided by some existing interpretable machine learning algorithms (random forests, scalable Bayesian Rules, causal models) in terms of the cognitive value they offer to the business owner. We hope that our work will foster future research in the field of transparent AI to incorporate the cognitive value of explanations in crafting and evaluating explanations.},

	abstract = {Example-based explanations are widely used in the effort to improve the interpretability of highly complex distributions. However, prototypes alone are rarely sufficient to represent the gist of the complexity. In order for users to construct better mental models and understand complex data distributions, we also need \{{\textbackslash}em criticism\} to explain what are {\textbackslash}textit\{not\} captured by prototypes.  Motivated by the Bayesian model criticism framework, we develop {\textbackslash}texttt\{MMD-critic\} which efficiently learns prototypes and criticism, designed to aid human interpretability. A human subject pilot study shows that the {\textbackslash}texttt\{MMD-critic\} selects prototypes and criticism that are useful to facilitate human understanding and reasoning. We also evaluate the prototypes selected by {\textbackslash}texttt\{MMD-critic\} via a nearest prototype classifier, showing competitive performance compared to baselines.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this research is to investigate if, and in that case, how and what the e‐government field can learn from user participation concepts and theories in general information systems (IS) research. It aims to contribute with further understanding of the importance of citizen participation and involvement within the e‐government research body of knowledge and when developing public e‐services in practice.

Design/methodology/approach
The analysis in the paper is made from a comparative, qualitative case study of two e‐government projects. Three analysis themes are induced from the literature review; practice of participation, incentives for participation, and organization of participation. These themes are guiding the comparative analysis of our data with a concurrent openness to interpretations from the field.

Findings
The main results in this paper are that the e‐government field can get inspiration and learn from methods and approaches in traditional IS projects concerning user participation, but in e‐government, methods are also needed to handle the challenges that arise when designing public e‐services for large, heterogeneous user groups. Citizen engagement cannot be seen as a separate challenge in e‐government, but rather as an integrated part of the process of organizing, managing, and performing e‐government projects. Analysis themes of participation generated from literature; practice, incentives and organization can be used in order to highlight, analyze, and discuss main issues regarding the challenges of citizen participation within e‐government. This is an important implication based on this paper that contributes both to theory on and practice of e‐government.

Practical implications
Lessons to learn from this paper concern that many e‐government projects have a public e‐service as one outcome and an internal e‐administration system as another outcome. A dominating internal, agency perspective in such projects might imply that citizens as the user group of the e‐service are only seen as passive receivers of the outcome – not as active participants in the development. By applying the analysis themes, proposed in this paper, citizens as active participants can be thoroughly discussed when initiating (or evaluating) an e‐government project.

Originality/value
The paper addresses challenges regarding citizen participation in e‐government development projects. User participation is well researched within the IS discipline, but the e‐government setting implies new challenges that are not explored enough.},

The focus of the tutorial is on the issues of transparency and interpretability as they relate to building models for text and their applications to knowledge discovery. As black-box models have gained popularity for a broad range of tasks in recent years, both the research and industry communities have begun developing new techniques to render them more transparent and interpretable. Reporting from an interdisciplinary team of social science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and NLP/knowledge management researchers, our tutorial has two components: an introduction to explainable AI (XAI) in the NLP domain and a review of the state-of-the-art research; and findings from a qualitative interview study of individuals working on real-world NLP projects as they are applied to various knowledge extraction and discovery at a large, multinational technology and consulting corporation. The first component will introduce core concepts related to explainability in NLP. Then, we will discuss explainability for NLP tasks and report on a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art literature in AI, NLP and HCI conferences. The second component reports on our qualitative interview study, which identifies practical challenges and concerns that arise in real-world development projects that require the modeling and understanding of text data.},

We discuss the problem of the biased interpretation of CNN predictions. To overcome the biased interpretation, we develop prior losses to guide the learning of the explainable additive model.

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.},

This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.},

Allowing machines to learn risk factors in a huge number of patients makes for better predictions of heart attacks. Machine-learning significantly improves accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction, increasing the number of patients identified who could benefit from preventive treatment, while avoiding unnecessary treatment of others. However, the use of machine learning algorithms has been limited due to the lack of interpretability of more complex models, reducing the trust of users in the model. The solution to the limitation of the ‘black-box’ nature of machine-learning algorithms, in particular neural networks, which are difficult to interpret, the inherent complexity in how the risk factor variables are interacting and their independent effects on the outcome is achieved through explainable AI.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

A large part of the effort of Transforming Musicology (as with any digital research) is concerned with data preparation, which in the early music case described here means dealing with the outputs of optical music recognition software, which inevitably contain errors.

	abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an emerging, multidisciplinary field of research that seeks to develop methods and tools for making AI systems more explainable or interpretable. XAI researchers increasingly recognise explainability as a context-, audience- and purpose-sensitive phenomenon, rather than a single well-defined property that can be directly measured and optimised. However, since there is currently no overarching definition of explainability, this poses a risk of miscommunication between the many different researchers within this multidisciplinary space. This is the problem we seek to address in this paper. We outline a framework, called Explanatory Pragmatism, which we argue has two attractive features. First, it allows us to conceptualise explainability in explicitly context-, audience- and purpose-relative terms, while retaining a unified underlying definition of explainability. Second, it makes visible any normative disagreements that may underpin conflicting claims about explainability regarding the purposes for which explanations are sought. Third, it allows us to distinguish several dimensions of AI explainability. We illustrate this framework by applying it to a case study involving a machine learning model for predicting whether patients suffering disorders of consciousness were likely to recover consciousness.},

Compared to other subjective methods, micro-phenomenology evokes and returns one to the moment of experience, allowing access to dimensions and observations which may not be recalled in reflection alone. We present a case study of five micro-phenomenological interviews conducted with musicians about their experiences with existing digital musical instruments. The interviews reveal deep, clear descriptions of different modalities of synchronic moments in interaction, especially in tactile connections and bodily sensations. We highlight the elements of interaction captured in these interviews which would not have been revealed otherwise and the importance of these elements in researching perception, understanding, interaction, and performance with digital musical instruments.},

Now is the time to interpret technosocial mediation from a range of disciplinary perspectives, rather than settling on a narrow canon of literature. To this end, our paper enacts a diffractive dialogue between researchers from different disciplines, focusing on digital musical instruments to examine how technical knowledge from design and engineering can be read against the grain of critical theories from music, media, and cultural studies. Drawing on two object lessons—keyboards and step sequencers, plus their remediations in recent musical interaction research—we highlight interdependencies of theory, design, and practice, and we show how the idea of entanglement is itself entangled in a cross-disciplinary web.},

I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

Hegemonic AI can be thought of as a bio-necro-technopolitical machine that serves to maintain the capitalist, colonialist and patriarchal order of the world. To make this point, the proposed approach bridges the macro and micropolitical, building on Suely Rolnik’s call for understanding the effects of the macropolitical in the micropolitical, as well as what feminist black scholar Patricia Hill Collins made visible about oppressive systems operating at the structural, institutional and individual levels. A critical AI ethics is one that is concerned with the preservation of life and the coresponsibility of AI harms to the majority of the planet.},

            This article presents a new software toolbox to enable programmatic mining of sound banks for musicking and musicking-driven research.

The article describes the design rationale and functionality of the toolbox and its ecosystem, then the development methodology—several versions of the toolbox have been seeded to early adopters who have, in turn, contributed to the design. Examples of these early usages are presented, and we describe some observed musical affordances of the proposed approach to the exploration and manipulation of music corpora, as well as the main roadblocks encountered. We finally reflect on a few emerging themes for the next steps in building a community around critical programmatic mining of sound banks.},

An ergotic gesture-sound situation is a situation where the instrumental gesture and the sound produced are intimately energetically linked. We perform two sets of experiments: the first aims at identifying the respective role of haptic and auditory perceptions in recognition of a virtual object, here a virtual bowed string; the second aims at evaluating the role of haptic and auditory perceptions with respect to action, in the achievement of a difficult musical task. The musical goal consists in maintaining the continuity of sound when changing bow direction. The first experiments are subjective experiments. They show that the feeling of presence of the bowed string is strongly reinforced when sounds and gestural friction are intimately linked, as is the case when the vibrations of the string are returned to the fingers. The second are subjective and objective experiments. They show that achieving the goal is significantly improved by instrumental force feedback. Further, they show that the main property of subjects' performance with the virtual bowed string is fast adaptive dynamic learning due to the physical relation between action plus gesture perception and auditory perception, and that playing and embodiment are notably improved by a strong physical haptic resistance.},

However, this race for quality comes at a tremendous computational cost, which incurs vast energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of this problem are the measures that we use as a scientific community to evaluate our work. In this paper, we suggest relying on a multi-objective measure based on Pareto optimality, which takes into account both the quality of the model and its energy consumption. By applying our measure on the current state-of-the-art in genera-tive audio models, we show that it can drastically change the significance of the results. We believe that this type of metric can be widely used by the community to evaluate their work, while putting computational cost-and in fine energy consumption-in the spotlight of deep learning research.},

This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed at identifying and classifying scientific literature about EUD, EUP and EUSE in the time range January 2000–May 2017. We selected 165 papers found through a manual selection of papers from specific conferences, journal special issues, and books, integrated with an automatic search on the most important digital libraries. The answer to our research question was built through a classification of the selected papers on seven dimensions: type of approach, interaction technique, phase in which the approach is adopted, application domain, target use, class of users, and type of evaluation. Our findings suggest that EUD, EUP and EUSE are active research topics not only in Human–Computer Interaction, but also in other research communities. However, little cross-fertilization exists among the three themes, as well as unifying frameworks and approaches for guiding novice designers and practitioners. Other findings highlight trends and gaps related to the analysis’ dimensions, which have implications on the design of future tools and suggest open issues for further investigations.},

	abstract = {The ability to explain decisions to end-users is a necessity to deploy AI as critical decision support. Yet making AI explainable to non-technical end-users is a relatively ignored and challenging problem. To bridge the gap, we first identify twelve end-user-friendly explanatory forms that do not require technical knowledge to comprehend, including feature-, example-, and rule-based explanations. We then instantiate the explanatory forms as prototyping cards in four AI-assisted critical decision-making tasks, and conduct a user study to co-design low-fidelity prototypes with 32 layperson participants. The results confirm the relevance of using explanatory forms as building blocks of explanations, and identify their proprieties - pros, cons, applicable explanation goals, and design implications. The explanatory forms, their proprieties, and prototyping supports (including a suggested prototyping process, design templates and exemplars, and associated algorithms to actualize explanatory forms) constitute the End-User-Centered explainable AI framework EUCA, and is available at http://weinajin.github.io/end-user-xai . It serves as a practical prototyping toolkit for HCI/AI practitioners and researchers to understand user requirements and build end-user-centered explainable AI.},

This can be limiting when computers are used in artistic performance or as mediators of social connection, where we rely on qualities of embodied thinking: intuition, context, resonance, ambiguity and ﬂuidity. We explore an alternative approach to designing interaction that we call the emergent interface: interaction leveraging unsupervised machine learning to replace designed abstractions with contextually derived emergent representations. The approach offers opportunities to create interfaces bespoke to a single individual, to continually evolve and adapt the interface in line with that individual’s needs and affordances, and to bridge more deeply with the complex and imprecise interaction that deﬁnes much of our non-digital communication. We explore this approach through artistic research rooted in music, dance and AI with the partially emergent system Soniﬁed Body. The system maps the moving body into sound using an emergent representation of the body derived from a corpus of improvised movement from the ﬁrst author. We explore this system in a residency with three dancers. We reﬂect on the broader implications and challenges of this alternative way of thinking about interaction, and how far it may help users avoid being limited by the assumptions of a system’s designer.},

The analysis of the ancient evidence concerning Epicurus' concept of pleasure is made according to the following principle: first, I consider the sources that do not mention the distinction between 'kinetic' and 'static' pleasures, and only then do I compare them with the other group of texts which comprises reports by Cicero, Diogenes Laertius and Athenaeus. From the former group of texts there emerges a concept of pleasure as a single and not twofold notion, while such terms as 'motion' and 'state' describe not two different phenomena but only two characteristics of the same phenomenon. On the other hand, the reports comprising the latter group appear to derive from one and the same doxographical tradition, and to be connected with the classification of ethical docrines put forward by the Middle Academy and known as the divisio Carneadea. In conclusion, I argue that the idea of Epicurus' classification of pleasures is based on a misinterpretation of Epicurus' concept in Academic doxography, which tended to contrapose it to doctrines of other schools, above all to the Cyrenaics' views.},

	abstract = {Given the complexity of human eating behaviors, developing interactions to change the way users eat or their choice of meals is challenging. In this study, we propose an interactive system called eat2pic designed to encourage healthy eating habits such as adopting a balanced diet and eating more slowly, by refraining the task of selecting meals into that of adding color to landscape pictures. The eat2pic system comprises a sensor-equipped chopstick (one of a pair) and two types of digital canvases. It provides fast feedback by recognizing a user's eating behavior in real time and displaying the result on a small canvas called "one-meal eat2pic." Moreover, it also provides slow feedback by displaying the number of colors of foods that the user consumed on a large canvas called "one-week eat2pic." The former was designed and implemented as a guide to help people eat more slowly, and the latter to encourage people to select more balanced menus. Through two user studies, we explored the experience of interaction with eat2pic, in which users' daily eating behavior was reflected in a series of "paintings," that is, images produced by the automated system. The experimental results suggest that eat2pic may provide an opportunity for reflection in meal selection and while eating, as well as assist users in becoming more aware of how they are eating and how balanced their daily meals are. We expect this system to inspire users' curiosity about different diets and ways of eating. This research also contributes to expanding the design space for products and services related to dietary support.},

These concepts posit that abstract thought is a sort of metaphor grounded in some phenomenological body-environment interaction. The intuitive environment that we exist in can be described using Euclidean geometry. Recently, Virtual Reality (VR) has been used to successfully simulate nonEuclidean environments. These are geometric spaces that are nonintuitive, and are counter to the Euclidean space that we perceive in our day-to-day life. Hence, building on the idea that Human Computer Interaction (HCI) can be used to experimentally test ideas in philosophy of mind, we look to explore how image-schemas and conceptualisation apply to immersive, non-Euclidean environments, simulated using VR.},

	abstract = {Sequential models achieve state-of-the-art results in audio, visual and textual domains with respect to both estimating the data distribution and generating desired samples. Efficient sampling for this class of models at the cost of little to no loss in quality has however remained an elusive problem. With a focus on text-to-speech synthesis, we describe a set of general techniques for reducing sampling time while maintaining high output quality. We first describe a single-layer recurrent neural network, the WaveRNN, with a dual softmax layer that matches the quality of the state-of-the-art WaveNet model. The compact form of the network makes it possible to generate 24 kHz 16-bit audio 4 times faster than real time on a GPU. Secondly, we apply a weight pruning technique to reduce the number of weights in the WaveRNN. We find that, for a constant number of parameters, large sparse networks perform better than small dense networks and this relationship holds past sparsity levels of more than 96\%. The small number of weights in a Sparse WaveRNN makes it possible to sample high-fidelity audio on a mobile phone CPU in real time. Finally, we describe a new dependency scheme for sampling that lets us trade a constant number of non-local, distant dependencies for the ability to generate samples in batches. The Batch WaveRNN produces 8 samples per step without loss of quality and offers orthogonal ways of further increasing sampling efficiency.},

	abstract = {Explainable neural models have gained a lot of attention in recent years. However, conventional encoder–decoder models do not capture information regarding the importance of the involved latent variables and rely on a heuristic a-priori specification of the dimensionality of the latent space or its selection based on multiple trainings. In this paper, we focus on the efficient structuring of the latent space of encoder–decoder approaches for explainable data reconstruction and compression. For this purpose, we leverage the concept of Shapley values to determine the contribution of the latent variables on the model’s output and rank them according to decreasing importance. As a result, a truncation of the latent dimensions to those that contribute the most to the overall reconstruction allows a trade-off between model compactness (i.e. dimensionality of the latent space) and representational power (i.e. reconstruction quality). In contrast to other recent autoencoder variants that incorporate a PCA-based ordering of the latent variables, our approach does not require time-consuming training processes and does not introduce additional weights. This makes our approach particularly valuable for compact representation and compression. We validate our approach at the examples of representing and compressing images as well as high-dimensional reflectance data.},

How sounds and bodily movements relate to create such effects? Here we deconstruct the problem and investigate how different auditory features affect people’s body-representation and feelings even when paired with the same movement. In three experiments, participants executed a simple arm raise synchronised with changing pitch in simple tones (Experiment 1), rich musical sounds (Experiment 2) and within different frequency ranges (Experiment 3), while we recorded indirect and direct measures on their movement, body-representations and feelings. Changes in pitch influenced people’s general emotional state as well as the various bodily dimensions investigated—movement, proprioceptive awareness and feelings about one’s body and movement. Adding harmonic content amplified the differences between ascending and descending sounds, while shifting the absolute frequency range had a general effect on movement amplitude, bodily feelings and emotional state. These results provide new insights in the role of auditory and musical features in dance and exercise, and have implications for the design of sound-based applications supporting movement expression, physical activity, or rehabilitation.},

The embodied cognition perspective can be a useful approach to the investigation of DMIs when examining many types of musical practice, even those involving high-level symbolic systems. The chapter explores the space of musical interaction contexts and activities; and presents a model adapted from the human-machine interaction literature. Many composers for DMIs choose to use dynamic mapping for their performances, in which the mapping connections change over time. Finally, the chapter addresses several pervasive beliefs regarding the design and use of DMIs, so that a more balanced approach can be taken.},

This can be limiting when computers are used in artistic performance or as mediators of social connection, where we rely on qualities of embodied thinking: intuition, context, resonance, ambiguity and ﬂuidity. We explore an alternative approach to designing interaction that we call the emergent interface: interaction leveraging unsupervised machine learning to replace designed abstractions with contextually derived emergent representations. The approach offers opportunities to create interfaces bespoke to a single individual, to continually evolve and adapt the interface in line with that individual’s needs and affordances, and to bridge more deeply with the complex and imprecise interaction that deﬁnes much of our non-digital communication. We explore this approach through artistic research rooted in music, dance and AI with the partially emergent system Soniﬁed Body. The system maps the moving body into sound using an emergent representation of the body derived from a corpus of improvised movement from the ﬁrst author. We explore this system in a residency with three dancers. We reﬂect on the broader implications and challenges of this alternative way of thinking about interaction, and how far it may help users avoid being limited by the assumptions of a system’s designer.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of widespread poverty and the increasing inequality in income distribution across nations point to the failure of the trickle-down theory. The long-held faith in the growth of income as the sole policy instrument to achieve the national objective of growth with equity has been put to the test. The increasing numbers of the poor, accompanied by the widening gap between the upper- and lower-income strata, have prompted researchers to explore the reasons for these shifts so that policies to address the problem can be formulated and implemented. Recent experience shows that micro-level intervention policies that empower individuals have been successful in achieving better results on this count. One such policy intervention is educational expansion, in terms of both quantity and quality. Education is considered to be a significant factor in building better human skills and hence largely affects the earning ability of an individual. This article explores the role of education as an intervening instrument for bringing about a socio-economic transformation. On the basis of primary data collected from the state of Odisha (in India), an attempt has been made to examine the possibility of achieving better income distribution and increased intergenerational movements through educational expansion and changes in educational policy.},

In NMP the performers (agents) are typically separated by distances, which in extreme cases add up to tens of thousands of kilometres. This implies that the interactions between the agents as well as the sounds they perceive are offset by latencies that can exceed the tolerable threshold for on-the-beat performance and may require the establishment of new musical genres. In order to fully realise the implications of NMP, the chapter presents a short historical overview before turning the attention to concepts underlying the nature of distributed performances. It focuses on critique current practices by acknowledging that NMP is particularly susceptible to various types of disembodiment, namely spatial separation, microtemporal fluctuations and poverty of sound production and transmission.},

	abstract = {Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments.},

	abstract = {In order to provide a practitioner’s perspective on the creative practices of live-electronic music – as different from instrumental, acousmatic and ‘musique mixte’ – this paper focuses on the performance of a particular composition by the author, Two Pieces of Listening and Surveillance, defined as an ‘autonomous sound-generating system with flute’. The fact that a musical instrument – a flute – is utilised, does not define this composition necessarily as following the ‘instrument plus electronics’ paradigm associated with performances of ‘musique mixte’. The instrument acts here as one of many components of a larger ‘performance ecosystem’: albeit admittedly a very important component. The instrument works as a functional element in a network of relationships and interdependencies among several sound-related resources, including electroacoustic transducers, analogue or computer-operated signal processing methods, and the surrounding physical space. This musical practice requires an exploratory attitude that situates the composer, the performer(s) and the audience in a shared field of active sonic relationships. The close intertwining of ‘instrument’ and ‘listening’ is discussed throughout the chapter in terms of a domain of experience bound up in the action-perception cycle – in other words, as a domain of situated embodied cognition (or ‘enaction’).},

They are error-prone when displaced, resulting in significant deviations from their ideal sensor output. In this work, we propose a novel prototype that integrates an elbow pad with a sparse network of soft sensors. Our prototype is fully bio-compatible, stretchable, and wearable. We develop a learning-based method to predict the elbow orientation angle and achieve an average tracking error of 9.82 degrees for single-user multi-motion experiments. With transfer learning, our method achieves the average tracking errors of 10.98 degrees and 11.81 degrees across different motion types and users, respectively. Our core contributions lie in a solution that realizes robust and stable human joint motion tracking across different device displacements.},

	abstract = {Exponential growth in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) has resulted in new opportunities and urgent needs for discovery of meaningful data-driven representations and patterns of diseases in Computational Phenotyping research. Deep Learning models have shown superior performance for robust prediction in computational phenotyping tasks, but suffer from the issue of model interpretability which is crucial for clinicians involved in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge-distillation approach called Interpretable Mimic Learning, to learn interpretable phenotype features for making robust prediction while mimicking the performance of deep learning models. Our framework uses Gradient Boosting Trees to learn interpretable features from deep learning models such as Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and Long Short-Term Memory. Exhaustive experiments on a real-world clinical time-series dataset show that our method obtains similar or better performance than the deep learning models, and it provides interpretable phenotypes for clinical decision making.},

	abstract = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

To gain insight into black-box models, we treat them as teachers, training transparent student models to mimic the risk scores assigned by black-box models. We compare the student model trained with distillation to a second un-distilled transparent model trained on ground-truth outcomes, and use differences between the two models to gain insight into the black-box model. Our approach can be applied in a realistic setting, without probing the black-box model API. We demonstrate the approach on four public data sets: COMPAS, Stop-and-Frisk, Chicago Police, and Lending Club. We also propose a statistical test to determine if a data set is missing key features used to train the black-box model. Our test finds that the ProPublica data is likely missing key feature(s) used in COMPAS.},

MIRLCa works as a customisable worldwide sampler, with sounds retrieved from the collective online Creative Commons (CC) database Freesound. The live-coding environment was developed in SuperCollider by the author in conversation with the live-coding community through a series of workshops and by observing its use by 16 live coders, including the author, in work-in-progress sessions, impromptu performances and concerts. This article presents a qualitative analysis of the workshops, work-in-progress sessions and performances. The findings identify (1) the advantages and disadvantages, and (2) the different compositional strategies that result from manipulating a digital sampler of online CC sounds in live coding. A prominent advantage of using sound samples in live coding is its low-entry access suitable for music improvisation. The article concludes by highlighting future directions relevant to performance, composition, musicology and education.},

The composition modules use an abstract representation of musical data, which can be easily mapped onto di erent synthesis languages or a traditionally notated score. An abstract base class is used to derive classes on di erent time scales. Objects can be related to act across time scales, as well as across an entire piece, and relationships between similar objects can replicate traditional music operations or introduce new ones.

Aimed at redressing increased theoretical and formalist emphasis in art historical discourse that arose during the nineteenth century, Tocchini’s project investigates eighteenth-century artistic expression in France through the writings of its philosophe-literati for evidence of veiled and often not-so-veiled political commentary. Anchored by Denis Diderot’s writings on the arts, especially entries for the Encyclopédie that he edited with Jean-Baptiste D’Alembert between 1713–1759 and his critiques of the biennial art exhibitions presented by the French Académie royale de l’art et de sculpture collected in Salons, the book sets out to reposition Diderot’s writings in areas of theatre, opera, literature, and fine art within the sociological and political contexts of their creation. Moreover, the book strives to document artistic production and its criticism in ways that evidence the Enlightenment’s “great cultural revolution,” the historic rupture that marks the demise of the ancien régime’s command of the arts and the collapse of the “immutable order” of French absolutism as represented in its artistic norms. The author supports this argument principally through a trenchant analysis of Diderot’s intellectual output, his connections to Rousseau’s political writings, and his involvement with the writings of other eminent philosophers such as Voltaire and Louis Sebastien Mercier.},

However, despite inclusive and open-source communities, disabled practitioners are underrepresented in live coding, and prior work highlights numerous accessibility barriers. To understand the perspectives of Blind and Low Vision (BLV) live coders, we formed FiLOrk (Fil Laptop Orchestra) with five BLV teens. Across two semesters, FiLOrk performed three original works, each guided by a core concept and improvisational structure for manipulating code and maintaining shared awareness. We interviewed four musicians to understand how they felt about the learning environment and how their creative identities formed individually and in relation to one another. We reflect on FiLOrk’s outcomes and propose strategies for future live coding ensembles to meaningfully include novices with and without disabilities.},

It offers an idealized model of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRF) in the primary auditory cortex, and thus may serve as a biological plausible surrogate for human perceptual judgments at the scale of isolated audio events. Yet, prior implementations of JTFS and STRF have remained outside of the standard toolkit of perceptual similarity measures and evaluation methods for audio generation. We trace this issue down to three limitations: differentiability, speed, and flexibility. In this paper, we present an implementation of time-frequency scattering in Python. Unlike prior implementations, ours accommodates NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow as backends and is thus portable on both CPU and GPU. We demonstrate the usefulness of JTFS via three applications: unsupervised manifold learning of spectrotemporal modulations, supervised classification of musical instruments, and texture resynthesis of bioacoustic sounds.},

I propose that digital inequalities research should look more into labor- and big data-related questions such as inequalities in online labor markets and the negative effects of algorithmic decision-making for vulnerable population groups. The article engages with the sociological literature on digital inequalities and explains the general approach to digital inequalities, based on the distinction of first-, second-, and third-level digital divides. First, inequalities in access to digital technologies are discussed. This discussion is extended to emerging technologies, including the Internet-of-things and artificial intelligence-powered systems such as smart speakers. Second, inequalities in digital skills and technology use are reviewed and connected to the discourse on new forms of work such as the sharing economy or gig economy. Third and finally, the discourse on the outcomes, in the form of benefits or harms, from digital technology use is taken up. Here, I propose to integrate the digital inequalities literature more strongly with critical algorithm studies and recent discussions about datafication, digital footprints, and information privacy.},

A typology is formed by grouping cases or participants into types on the basis of their common features. Despite the prominence of typologies in research, methodological guidance on the process of developing a typology, particularly as a qualitative method for analysing data, is scarce. Ideal-type analysis is a relatively new addition to the family of qualitative research methods, which offers a systematic, rigorous method for constructing typologies from qualitative data. In our approach to ideal-type analysis, the methodology consists of seven steps: becoming familiarised with the dataset; writing the case reconstructions; constructing the ideal types; identifying the optimal cases; forming the ideal-type descriptions; checking credibility; and making comparisons. This article is a summary of our approach to conducting ideal-type analysis. We hope that this article will help researchers to consider whether using ideal-type analysis may be a suitable approach for their own studies.},

Scholars of ancient philosophy have traditionally focused on Plato's and Aristotle's dialectic without paying much attention to the diverse conceptions and uses of dialectic presented by philosophers after the classical period. To bridge this gap, this volume aims at a comprehensive understanding of the competing Hellenistic and Imperial definitions of dialectic and their connections with those of the classical period. It starts from the Megaric school of the fourth century BCE and the early Peripatetics, via Epicurus, the Stoics, the Academic sceptics and Cicero, to Sextus Empiricus and Galen in the second century CE. The philosophical foundations and various uses of dialectic are closely analysed and systematically examined together with the numerous objections that were raised against them},

	abstract = {Dialectic of Enlightenment is undoubtedly the most influential publication of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Written during the Second World War and circulated privately, it appeared in a printed edition in Amsterdam in 1947.'What we had set out to do,'the authors write in the Preface,'was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism.'Yet the work goes far beyond a mere critique of contemporary events. Historically remote developments, indeed, the birth of Western history and of subjectivity itself out of the struggle against natural forces, as represented in myths, are connected in a wide arch to the most threatening experiences of the present. The book consists in five chapters, at first glance unconnected, together with a number of shorter notes. The various analyses concern such phenomena as the detachment of science from practical life, formalized morality, the manipulative nature of entertainment culture, and a paranoid behavioral structure, expressed in aggressive anti-Semitism, that marks the limits of enlightenment. The authors perceive a common element in these phenomena, the tendency toward self-destruction of the guiding criteria inherent in enlightenment thought from the beginning. Using historical analyses to elucidate the present, they show, against the background of a prehistory of subjectivity, why the National Socialist terror was not an aberration of modern history but was rooted deeply in the fundamental characteristics of Western civilization. Adorno and Horkheimer see the self-destruction of Western reason as grounded in a historical and fateful dialectic between the domination of external nature and society. They trace enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, back to its mythical roots. Enlightenment and myth, therefore, are not irreconcilable opposites, but dialectically mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life.'Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology.'This paradox is the fundamental thesis of the book. This new translation, based on the text in the complete edition of the works of Max Horkheimer, contains textual variants, commentary upon them, and an editorial discussion of the position of this work in the development of Critical Theory.},

	abstract = {This thesis is about the design of software which enables groups of people to make music together. Networked musical interaction has been an important aspect of Sound and Music Computing research since the early days, although collaborative music software has yet to gain mainstream popularity, and there is currently limited research on the design of such interfaces. This thesis draws on research from Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) to explore the design of systems for Collaborative Digital Musical Interaction (CDMI). A central focus of this research is the concept of Awareness: a person’s understanding of what is happening, and of who is doing what. A novel software interface is developed and used over three experimental studies to investigate the effects different interface designs have on the way groups of musicians collaborate. Existing frameworks from CSCW are extended to accommodate the properties of music as an auditory medium, and theories of conventional musical interaction are used to elaborate on the nature of music making as a collaborative and social activity which is focused on process-oriented creativity. This research contributes to the ﬁelds of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Supported Cooperative Work, and Sound and Music Computing through the identiﬁcation of empirically derived design implications and recommendations for collaborative musical environments. These guidelines are demonstrated through the design of a hypothetical collaborative music system. This thesis also contributes towards the methodology for evaluating such systems, and considers the distinctions between CDMI and the forms of collaboration traditionally studied within CSCW.},

UX designers face hurdles understanding AI technologies, such as pre-trained language models, as design materials. This limits their ability to ideate and make decisions about whether, where, and how to use AI. To address this problem, we bridge the literature on AI design and AI transparency to explore whether and how frameworks for transparent model reporting can support design ideation with pre-trained models. By interviewing 23 UX practitioners, we find that practitioners frequently work with pre-trained models, but lack support for UX-led ideation. Through a scenario-based design task, we identify common goals that designers seek model understanding for and pinpoint their model transparency information needs. Our study highlights the pivotal role that UX designers can play in Responsible AI and calls for supporting their understanding of AI limitations through model transparency and interrogation.},

A typology is formed by grouping cases or participants into types on the basis of their common features. Despite the prominence of typologies in research, methodological guidance on the process of developing a typology, particularly as a qualitative method for analysing data, is scarce. Ideal-type analysis is a relatively new addition to the family of qualitative research methods, which offers a systematic, rigorous method for constructing typologies from qualitative data. In our approach to ideal-type analysis, the methodology consists of seven steps: becoming familiarised with the dataset; writing the case reconstructions; constructing the ideal types; identifying the optimal cases; forming the ideal-type descriptions; checking credibility; and making comparisons. This article is a summary of our approach to conducting ideal-type analysis. We hope that this article will help researchers to consider whether using ideal-type analysis may be a suitable approach for their own studies.},

Such design attends to questions of environment, experience, and politics while focusing on the production of human experience based on the radical interdependence of all beings. Mapping autonomous design’s principles to the history of decolonial efforts of indigenous and Afro-descended people in Latin America, Escobar shows how refiguring current design practices could lead to the creation of more just and sustainable social orders.},

Given the high level of expectation from designers, the interface quality was one of the most challenging aspects of the work, in conjunction with the utility of the functionalities. An iterative design and evaluation process was used to create the icon-based interface, during which the needs of the designers and the functionalities of the system were integrated until a complete operational prototype emerged. This process provided three sequential prototypes. In order to achieve this, we derived qualitative and quantitative results from various methods: creative sessions, semantic and emotional evaluations, questionnaires, semidirective interviews, subjective performance assessments, longitudinal tests, and focus group assessments. Finally, our iterative design and evaluation process can be considered to be a very efficient means of integrating end users’ spontaneous feedback about icon redesigns in the early phases of development. The design outcome enabled the end users to ensure that key features of the creativity support tool were both usable and appealing.},

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building humancentered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.},

It is perceived that knowledge is primarily obtained through the act of designing, which encompasses not only verbal conversation with other humans but also real-time material interactions with each person’s physical environment. However, since the global COVID-19 pandemic, design students, educators, and institutions around the world have had to quickly adapt to working and collaborating on digital platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Team, etc. At the same time, there has been a lack of understanding of what these digital platforms can do in collaborative design activities. The study presented in this article aims at exploring the effects of digital platforms on real-time collaborative design activities with a focus on object handling and communication, which are key elements of studio-based interactions. The participant in this study was invited to finish a small collaborative task which entailed building a paper toy with the researcher on Microsoft Teams. It was discovered that apart from facilitating the communication between the participant and the researcher, the digital platform was continuously regionalising, de-regionalising, and re-regionalising the space in the rooms the researcher and participant were working in. This characteristic of the digital platform opens new doorways to studying the roles technologies play in design education that embraces the contextual nature of pedagogical practices in the changing environment of the 21st century.},

	abstract = {What is the relationship between design, power, and social justice? “Design justice” is an approach to design that is led by marginalized communities and that aims expilcitly to challenge, rather than reproduce, structural inequalities. It has emerged from a growing community of designers in various fields who work closely with social movements and community-based organizations around the world.

This book explores the theory and practice of design justice, demonstrates how universalist design principles and practices erase certain groups of people—specifically, those who are intersectionally disadvantaged or multiply burdened under the matrix of domination (white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism)—and invites readers to “build a better world, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability.” Along the way, the book documents a multitude of real-world community-led design practices, each grounded in a particular social movement. Design Justice goes beyond recent calls for design for good, user-centered design, and employment diversity in the technology and design professions; it connects design to larger struggles for collective liberation and ecological survival.},

	abstract = {Film theory has for so long been concerned with sociological, empirical and psychoanalytic approaches that its place within our aesthetic sensibilities seems to have been forgotten.Deleuze and Cinema aims to bring back debates about film as an art form - as part of an aesthetic process which incorporates the 'bodies' of our material, technological and molecular worlds. While much film theory has looked at desire in terms of (visual and spectator) pleasure, Barbara Kennedy suggests, in this provocative new study, that these different perceptions of 'body' are responsible, as well as the brain/mind, for the ways in which visual elements of colour, movement, rhythm and sensation are acquired within, through and beyond our consciousness.Film is visceral, vital and dynamic, and wider frameworks of understanding are needed to explain these aesthetic resonances. Deleuze and Cinema asks: how can we begin to understand the cinematic experience as one of material capture, processuality and movement - as opposed to a spectator/text relationship - where desire and pleasure are part of a complex 'aesthetics of sensation'?Through discussions of Orlando, The English Patient, Romeo and Juliet, Strange Days and Leon the book offers a new and creative collusion between Deleuzian philosophy - specifically Deleuze's ideas about desire, pleasure, sensation, affect and 'becoming-woman' - and contemporary film studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to define Web 3.0 and discuss the underlying technologies, identify new opportunities and highlight potential challenges that are associated with the evolution to Web 3.0 technologies. Design/methodology/approach A non-empirical study reviewing papers published in accredited research journals, articles and whitepapers and websites was conducted. To add scientific rigour to a literature review, a four-stage approach, as suggested by Sylvester et al. (2011), was used. Findings The World Wide Web (henceforth referred to as the Web) is recognised as the fastest growing publication medium of all time. To stay competitive, it is crucial to stay up to date with technological trends. The Web matures in its own unique way. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0, it progressed into the interactive experience Web 2.0 provides. The next phase of Web evolution, Web 3.0, is already in progress. Web 3.0 entails an integrated Web experience where the machine will be able to understand and catalogue data in a manner similar to humans. This will facilitate a world wide data warehouse where any format of data can be shared and understood by any device over any network. The evolution of the Web will bring forth new opportunities and challenges. Opportunities identified can mainly be characterised as the autonomous integration of data and services which increase the pre-existing capabilities of Web services, as well as the creation of new functionalities. The challenges mainly concern unauthorised access and manipulation of data, autonomous initiation of actions and the development of harmful scripts and languages. Practical implications The findings will assist data managers to identify future opportunities while considering negative impacts and understanding the underlying technologies associated with the structure and storage of electronic information. The research will assist anyone in the data and information management industry to identify opportunities and mitigate risk. Originality/value Many organisations were caught off guard by the evolution of the Web to Web 2.0. Organisations, and in particular anyone in the data and information management industry, need to be ready and acquire knowledge about the opportunities and challenges arising from Web 3.0 technologies.},

	abstract = {IIn a long overdue contribution to geography and social theory, Katherine McKittrick offers a new and powerful interpretation of black women’s geographic thought. In Canada, the Caribbean, and the United States, black women inhabit diasporic locations marked by the legacy of violence and slavery. Analyzing diverse literatures and material geographies, McKittrick reveals how human geographies are a result of racialized connections, and how spaces that are fraught with limitation are underacknowledged but meaningful sites of political opposition. Demonic Grounds moves between past and present, archives and fiction, theory and everyday, to focus on places negotiated by black women during and after the transatlantic slave trade. Specifically, the author addresses the geographic implications of slave auction blocks, Harriet Jacobs’s attic, black Canada and New France, as well as the conceptual spaces of feminism and Sylvia Wynter’s philosophies. Central to McKittrick’s argument are the ways in which black women are not passive recipients of their surroundings and how a sense of place relates to the struggle against domination. Ultimately, McKittrick argues, these complex black geographies are alterable and may provide the opportunity for social and cultural change. Katherine McKittrick is assistant professor of women’s studies at Queen’s University.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the last thirty years, work in analytic philosophy of art has flourished, and it has given rise to considerably controversy. Stephen Davies describes and analyzes the definition of art as it has been discussed in Anglo-American philosophy during this period and, in the process, introduces his own perspective on ways in which we should reorient our thinking.Davies conceives of the debate as revealing two basic, conflicting approaches—the functional and the procedural—to the questions of whether art can be defined, and if so, how. As the author sees it, the functionalist believes that an object is a work of art only if it performs a particular function (usually, that of providing a rewarding aesthetic experience). By contrast the proceduralist believes that something is an artwork only if it has been created according to certain rules and procedures. Davies attempts to demonstrate the fruitfulness of viewing the debate in terms of this framework, and he develops new arguments against both points of view—although he is more critical of functional than of procedural definitions.Because it has generated so much of the recent literature, Davies starts his analysis with a discussion of Morris Weitz's germinal paper, "The Role of Theory in Aesthetics." He goes on to examine other important works by Arthur Danto, George Dickie, and Ben Tilghman and develops in his critiques original arguments on such matters of the artificiality of artworks and the relevance of artists' intentions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Russell (1919), writing in prison, made the following now famousdeclaration of the importance of definite descriptions, and inparticular the definite determiner ‘the’:, Russell has not been alone in thinking that descriptions and definitedeterminers are important. The discussion of definite and indefinitedescriptions (in English, phrases of the form‘the F’ and ‘anF’) has been at the center of analytic philosophy for over acentury now. The reason that philosophers find these apparently simpleexpressions so intriguing is that choices made about their properlogical analysis have repercussions that extend far beyond thephilosophy of language and philosophy of logic. In BertrandRussell’s hands, for example, the analysis of descriptionsbecame a powerful tool for executing important epistemological andmetaphysical projects., Despite the surface simplicity of determiners and of definite andindefinite descriptions, the past 100+ years have seen heated debatesabout their proper analysis. Some philosophers and linguists treatdescriptions as referential expressions, others have treated them asquantificational expressions, and some have treated them aspredicational expressions. Other analyses of descriptions have heldthat the determiners ‘the’ and ‘a’ do not makea semantical contribution, but rather a pragmatic contribution to whatis communicated.  Some recent work in linguistics has even called intoquestion the idea that definite and indefinite determiners correspondto logical elements in the analysis of the logical form of naturallanguage. Indeed, there is some reason to think that they are merelygrammatical elements for assigning case. , As we will see, none of this undermines the idea that some expressionsof natural language are referential and others quantificational, orthat the analysis of these questions isn’t relevant to Russell’sepistemological and metaphysical projects, but it is to suggest thatthe role of the English words ‘the’ and ‘a’(and their counterparts in other languages) may be less clear thanphilosophers in the one hundred years since Russell have imagined.},

However, the recency of this phenomenon means analysis has been lagging; particularly, analysis of broader impacts of real-world initiatives. Addressing this gap through a focus on data’s increasing presence in urban development, this paper makes two contributions. First – drawing from the emerging literature on ‘data justice’ – it presents an explicit, systematic and comprehensive new framework that can be used for analysis of datafication. Second, it applies the framework to four mapping initiatives in cities of the global South. These initiatives capture and visualise new data about marginalised communities: residents living in slums and other informal settlements about whom data has traditionally been lacking. Analysing across procedural, rights, instrumental and structural dimensions, it finds these initiatives deliver real incremental gains for their target communities. But it is external actors and wealthier communities that gain more; thus, increasing relative inequality.},

	abstract = {FM Synthesis is a well-known algorithm used to generate complex timbre from a compact set of design primitives. Typically featuring a MIDI interface, it is usually impractical to control it from an audio source. On the other hand, Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) has enabled nuanced audio rendering by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that learn to control differentiable synthesis layers from arbitrary sound inputs. The training process involves a corpus of audio for supervision, and spectral reconstruction loss functions. Such functions, while being great to match spectral amplitudes, present a lack of pitch direction which can hinder the joint optimization of the parameters of FM synthesizers. In this paper, we take steps towards enabling continuous control of a well-established FM synthesis architecture from an audio input. Firstly, we discuss a set of design constraints that ease spectral optimization of a differentiable FM synthesizer via a standard reconstruction loss. Next, we present Differentiable DX7 (DDX7), a lightweight architecture for neural FM resynthesis of musical instrument sounds in terms of a compact set of parameters. We train the model on instrument samples extracted from the URMP dataset, and quantitatively demonstrate its comparable audio quality against selected benchmarks.},

We consider two visualisation techniques, based on computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image. The first one generates an image, which maximises the class score [Erhan et al., 2009], thus visualising the notion of the class, captured by a ConvNet. The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets. Finally, we establish the connection between the gradient-based ConvNet visualisation methods and deconvolutional networks [Zeiler et al., 2013].},

	abstract = {The deindustrialisation of New York City during the post-war period peaked in the early seventies and Gordon Matta-Clark was one of the people primarily responsible for the physical and social transformation of these disused industrial areas. The historic waterfront area, derelict and empty, was a centre of experimentation for many artists. This film documents the progress of one Matta-Clark's most ambitious and controversial deconstruction projects, one for which he was threatened with lawsuits over several months. As in the past, he sought to recover a lost and abandoned part of the city for public enjoyment and collective creation.
To this end the artist chose a building located on Pier 52, a relic of the 19th century industrial past, on which he made a series of cuts, sometimes under dangerous conditions. The reason for these complicated manoeuvres and contortions in the air can be understood as an absurd, humorous gesture, a sort of tribute to the stars of silent films like Harold Lloyd, while also showing his interest for dance and performance. In this monumental industrial building made of steel and corrugated metal with an interior reminiscent of a Christian basilica, Matta-Clark created shaped apertures by removing several sections of the roof and walls – a sail on the wall facing the river, a rose window on the western wall, a quarter circle on the south-east floor – which created a sequence of changing light patterns and reflections on the surface of the Hudson River. Although this was one of Matta-Clark's longest-surviving interventions (two years), he failed to convert it into the cultural catalyst he intended and the building was closed by the police on the day of its inauguration and stood abandoned until its demolition.},

We call these Deep Visual Instruments: realtime interactive generative systems that exploit and leverage the capabilities of state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNN), while allowing Meaningful Human Control, in a Realtime Continuous manner. We characterise Meaningful Human Control in terms of intent, predictability, and accountability; and Realtime Continuous Control with regards to its capacity for performative interaction with immediate feedback, enhancing goal-less exploration. The capabilities of DNNs that we are looking to exploit and leverage in this manner, are their ability to learn hierarchical representations modelling highly complex, real-world data such as images. Thinking of DNNs as tools that extract useful information from massive amounts of Big Data, we investigate ways in which we can navigate and explore what useful information a DNN has learnt, and how we can meaningfully use such a model in the production of artistic and creative works, in a performative, expressive manner. We present five studies that approach this from different but complementary angles. These include: a collaborative, generative sketching application using MCTS and discriminative CNNs; a system to gesturally conduct the realtime generation of text in different styles using an ensemble of LSTM RNNs; a performative tool that allows for the manipulation of hyperparameters in realtime while a Convolutional VAE trains on a live camera feed; a live video feed processing software that allows for digital puppetry and augmented drawing; and a method that allows for long-form story telling within a generative model's latent space with meaningful control over the narrative. We frame our research with the realtime, performative expression provided by musical instruments as a metaphor, in which we think of these systems as not used by a user, but played by a performer.},

We report on initial findings of a study of a knowledge-broker organisation, where we follow how data are produced, shared, and maintained in a cross-organisational context. We discuss similarities and differences of HDI around personal health data and cross-organisational data maintenance.

	abstract = {The link between musicians and dancers is generally described as strong in many traditional musics and this holds also for Scandinavian Folk Music - spelmansmusik. Understanding the interaction of music and dance has potential for developing theories of performance strategies in artistic practice and for developing interactive systems. In this paper we investigate this link by having Swedish folk musicians perform to animations generated from motion capture recordings of dancers. The different stimuli focus on motions of selected body parts as moving white dots on a computer screen with the aim to understand how different movements can provide reliable cues for musicians. Sound recordings of ﬁddlers playing to the ”dancing dot” were analyzed using automatic alignment to the original music performance related to the dance recordings. Interviews were conducted with musicians and comments were collected in order to shed light on strategies when playing for dancing. Results illustrate a reliable alignment to renderings showing full skeletons of dancers, and an advantage of focused displays of movements in the upper back of the dancer.},

The notion of automating the process of live coding entails interesting philosophical, conceptual, and technical questions. While touching upon all these implications, this paper focuses on design decisions and technical aspects as responds to artistic requirements on such a generative, interactive system intended for generating computer code as makeshift music scores. With the existing assortment of techniques for algorithmic composition and text generation, one of the challenges was selecting the most appropriate approach for the task. We noticed a strong interdependence between material (a base corpus of source code) and the process (the generative algorithm) which motivated a novel, hybrid approach that targeted both the required systematization of the corpus and devising a custom algorithmic solution.},

It is reflection on observing bodily movements in artistic settings to view human social interactions, multimodal communication, and cognitive processes through a different lens, that of the close collaboration between performing artists, designers, and scholars. This collection focuses simultaneously on methods and technologies for creating, documenting, or representing dance data. The editors highlight works focusing on the dancers' embodied minds, including research using neural, cognitive, behavioural, and linguistic data in the context of dance composition processes. Each chapter deals with dance data from an interdisciplinary perspective, presenting theoretical and methodological discussions emerging from empirical studies, as well as more experimental ones.

The newspaper texts were taken from Herald Glasgow, with permission from Herald \& Times Group. Each speaker has a different set of the newspaper texts selected based a greedy algorithm that increases the contextual and phonetic coverage.  
 
The details of the text selection algorithms are described in the following paper:  
C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi and S. King,  
"The voice bank corpus: Design, collection and data analysis of  
a large regional accent speech database,"  
https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2013.6709856 
 
The rainbow passage and elicitation paragraph are the same for all speakers. The rainbow passage can be found at International Dialects of English Archive: (http://web.ku.edu/{\textasciitilde}idea/readings/rainbow.htm). The elicitation paragraph is identical to the one used for the speech accent archive (http://accent.gmu.edu). The details of the the speech accent archive can be found at 
http://www.ualberta.ca/{\textasciitilde}aacl2009/PDFs/WeinbergerKunath2009AACL.pdf 
 
All speech data was recorded using an identical recording setup: an omni-directional microphone (DPA 4035) and a small diaphragm condenser microphone with very wide bandwidth (Sennheiser MKH 800), 96kHz sampling frequency at 24 bits and in a hemi-anechoic chamber of the University of Edinburgh. (However, two speakers, p280 and p315 had technical issues of the audio recordings using MKH 800). All recordings were converted into 16 bits, were downsampled to 48 kHz, and were manually end-pointed. 
 
This corpus was originally aimed for HMM-based text-to-speech synthesis systems, especially for speaker-adaptive HMM-based speech synthesis that uses average voice models trained on multiple speakers and speaker adaptation technologies. This corpus is also suitable for DNN-based multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis systems and neural waveform modeling. 
 
The dataset was was referenced in the Google DeepMind work on WaveNet: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf . Please note while text files containing transcripts of the speech are provided for 109 of the 110 recordings, in the '/txt' folder, the 'p315' text was lost due to a hard disk error.},

The proposed approach consists of two variational autoencoder (VAE) networks which generate and model the latent space of each modality. The ﬁrst network is a multi-modal variational autoencoder that maps directly one modality to the other, while the second one is a single-modal variational autoencoder. In order to associate the two spaces, we apply variational alignment, which acts as a translation mechanism that projects the latent space of the ﬁrst VAE onto the one of the single-modal VAE through an intermediate distribution. Experimental results on four well-known datasets, covering two different application domains (food image analysis and 3D hand pose estimation), show the generality of the proposed method and its superiority against a number of state-of-the-art approaches.},

Drawing from critical data studies, we examine the case of Facebook's Oculus VR-a market leading VR technology, central to their metaverse ambitions. Through this case, we argue that VR as a data-intensive device is not one of unalloyed benefit, but one fraught with power inequity-one that has the potential to exacerbate wealth inequity, institute algorithmic bias, and bring about new forms of digital exclusion. We contend that policy to date has had limited engagement with VR, and that regulatory intervention will be needed as VR becomes more widely adopted in society.},

We propose that such restrictions can be grounded by considerations of intimacy. Consider the familiar phenomenon of interpersonal intimacy. Certain aspects of personal life and interpersonal relationships are afforded various protections in virtue of being intimate. We argue that an analogous phenomenon exists at the level of large groups. In many cases, members of a group engage in shared practices that contribute to a sense of common identity, such as wearing certain hair or clothing styles or performing a certain style of music. Participation in such practices can generate relations of group intimacy, which can ground certain prerogatives in much the same way that interpersonal intimacy can. One such prerogative is making what we call an appropriation claim. An appropriation claim is a request from a group member that non-members refrain from appropriating a given element of the group’s culture. Ignoring appropriation claims can constitute a breach of intimacy. But, we argue, just as for the prerogatives of interpersonal intimacy, in many cases there is no prior fact of the matter about whether the appropriation of a given cultural practice would consitute a breach of intimacy. It depends on what the group decides together.},

Though I believe that Nguyen and Strohl’s account offers important insight into an essential dimension of the cultural appropriation debate, I argue that justified objections to cultural appropriation must ultimately be grounded in considerations of oppression as opposed to group intimacy. I present three primary objections to the intimacy account. First, I suggest that in its effort to explain expressive appropriation claims (those that purportedly lack an independent ground), the intimacy account doubles down on the boundary problem. Second, I question whether group intimacy possess the kind of bare normativity that Nguyen and Strohl claim for it. Finally, I argue that these objections give us reason to accept the importance of group intimacy to the cultural appropriation debate, but question the source of its significance as identified by Nguyen and Strohl.},

Several behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging data collected in various tasks, including localization and detection of spatial events, crossmodal perception of object properties and scene analysis are reviewed here. All the results highlight the multiple faces of crossmodal interactions and provide converging evidence that the brain takes advantages of spatial and temporal coincidence between spatial events in the crossmodal binding of spatial features gathered through different modalities. Furthermore, the elaboration of a multimodal percept appears to be based on an adaptive combination of the contribution of each modality, according to the intrinsic reliability of sensory cue, which itself depends on the task at hand and the kind of perceptual cues involved in sensory processing. Computational models based on bayesian sensory estimation provide valuable explanations of the way perceptual system could perform such crossmodal integration. Recent anatomical evidence suggest that crossmodal interactions affect early stages of sensory processing, and could be mediated through a dynamic recurrent network involving backprojections from multimodal areas as well as lateral connections that can modulate the activity of primary sensory cortices, though future behavioral and neurophysiological studies should allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

The tools developed thus far focus on edge detection, confidence thresholds, and sensitivity, and were designed based on principles from learning sciences and user-centered design to make AI accessible and ethically reflective. My efforts have resulted in successful design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation. Conducted with 42 adult participants, the study reveals notable improvements in familiarity with and confidence in discussing AI concepts. Qualitative feedback highlights user engagement and enhanced understanding, demonstrating immediate impact and laying a foundation for ongoing work. Looking forward, my work will delve deeper into how non-experts can critically engage with AI’s decision-making processes, understand algorithmic trade-offs, and consider how AI can better serve society. This approach broadens AI literacy and leverages cognitive principles for creative and ethical technological interventions.},

	abstract = {A growing number of scholars are exploring ideas ‘in the wild’ and across different timescales through qualitative research, and especially ethnography. Previous controlled and lab-based studies have formalized techniques to encourage idea development and outlined measurements to rate the success of produced ideas based on quantity, quality, novelty, and variety. Qualitative ’in the wild’ research aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding the evolution of ideas, how prior ideas shape new ones, and what other factors impact ideas and their development within a professional setting. However, these studies have been hindered due to difficulty around knowing how to ’do’ ethnography and to interpret findings through a theoretical lens via ethnographic analysis and writing in creativity studies, HCI, and Design. This paper provides an in-depth discussion of an ethnographic analysis and writing process from a year-long fieldstudy with designers at a large Danish library. In doing so, it also contributes a better understanding of how to do ethnography on ideas to promote a betterment of the scholarship on ideas, designing, and creativity in the field of creativity studies, HCI, and design.},

The goal is to develop improved software and user interfaces that empower users to be not only more productive but also more innovative. Potential users include software and other engineers, diverse scientists, product and graphic designers, architects, educators, students, and many others. Enhanced interfaces could enable more effective searching of intellectual resources, improved collaboration among teams, and more rapid discovery processes. These advanced interfaces should also provide potent support in hypothesis formation, speedier evaluation of alternatives, improved understanding through visualization, and better dissemination of results. For creative endeavors that require composition of novel artifacts (e.g., computer programs, scientific papers, engineering diagrams, symphonies, artwork), enhanced interfaces could facilitate exploration of alternatives, prevent unproductive choices, and enable easy backtracking. This U.S. National Science Foundation sponsored workshop brought together 25 research leaders and graduate students to share experiences, identify opportunities, and formulate research challenges. Two key outcomes emerged: (a) encouragement to evaluate creativity support tools through multidimensional in-depth longitudinal case studies and (b) formulation of 12 principles for design of creativity support tools.},

But it is also a potential site for participatory design, solidarity design and other methods for co-developing innovative strategies by which automation can support the rise of an unalienated economy.

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to devise a theoretical system with an alternate division of the octave that includes all the necessary material such that a performer or composer could utilize this system efficiently and intuitively. For the purposes of this project, the system will be applied to the cello, as its rich timbre and continuous pitch control make it an optimal choice. While there has been significant research in the field of microtonality and octave division, the field is extremely widespread and therefore difficult to unify, and subsequently difficult to transfer knowledge intuitively. This is in large part due to the fact that the theory and notation behind this previous research typically involves bending the current western system to fit the purposes of a new system, rather than creating a bespoke theoretical and notational system optimized for its own purpose. For the purposes of this research, the octave will be divided into sixteen equal steps. A principal reason for this choice is that this division will preserve the traditional minor third, an interval musicians will already be familiar with, and divides it into four parts rather than its usual four, a technique I have adapted from musician Jacob Collier. Included in this complete system is a manual for the instruction of a potential user, which includes a theoretical exploration of the octave in sixteen divisions, instructions on how to prepare the cello, and novel notation for writing the pitches. The manual also includes etudes to aid a performer in learning the system. To further aid, recordings of the etudes are also included, as well as a patch in the Max software capable of realizing pitches within the octave of sixteen divisions.},

	abstract = {The medium and genre of the mixtape, a form dependent upon borrowed, repurposed and re-contextualised sonic material, has recently re-emerged as a vital component of contemporary commercial and creative music culture. This article suggests that analysis of the mixtape’s history and ethos can provide useful insight into ongoing tensions between cultures of active and passive listening, questions of ownership with regard to recorded sound and between the roles of producer and consumer within contemporary audio culture. It also proposes, via reference to relevant contemporary works, that the mixtape may now be considered a vital hybrid creative form, part composition/part compilation, with which composers, producers and sonic artists may actively engage. It historically and culturally contextualises this form, placing it within a lineage of military, political, creative and commercial conflict, which, among recorded sound technologies, is unique to tape and shows that the mixtape may be seen as an expression or utilisation of these factors. Consistent commercial and industrial efforts to suppress tape’s subversive qualities are outlined as are creative methodologies which have been adopted to resist such efforts. Contemporary music industry strategies to channel and commodify the aura and ethos of the mixtape as forerunner of the curated playlists vital to its current business model are detailed and contemporary cassette culture is considered as an alternative inheritor of the mixtape’s legacy and as alternative model for future musical creation and distribution. Finally, a set of characteristics which distinguish the mixtape as a creative form are identified and their potential application and implications are discussed.},

The objective of the study is to find out the distinctive features of autist-normal conversations. This study is cross-sectional, descriptive and qualitative in its nature. Recordings are done in an autism center in Lahore for a period of ten days. It is mainly a qualitative study in its nature. Five autistic children of different ages are selected from an autism center in Lahore. The data for the study is collected through video recording of the conversations between autists and speech therapists. The sample is selected through convenient sampling and analysis is done by following the methods of conversation analysis. The results of the analysis highlight certain distinct features of autist child-therapist talk which are not observed in the normal ordinary conversation. However, there is not a total violation of the conversation rules on the part of autists. Moreover, the findings of the research show that conversational patterns in autist-normal conversation are also affected by the chronological age of the autists. Finally, the research concludes that conversation analysis can be used as a tool for the identification of autism.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper presents the prospects of viewing ?sustainable mobility? as a merger of seemingly opposing values and ideas into a coherent and fully emplotted myth. Myth, in this sense, is not a false story meant to amuse or discredit, but rather a story based on naturalised beliefs giving it the supremacy of the obvious. Through the process of emplotment, myths create internal logics that help relieve anxiety, rationalise behaviour and naturalise societal and individual convictions. As such, myths are a fundamental and habitual part of life. The myth of sustainable mobility is not one, but two stories ? that of development as quantitative growth and the discourse of sustainability ? which are merged, emplotted and naturalised. It is based on the fears of economic and environmental collapse, but while fear is an essential characteristic of myth and a source of much of its power the myth also offers hope. The hope lies in the promise of continued trends of increased mobility while still being able to preserve the world for ?future generations?. This entangles the very notions of mobility, development and sustainability, creating a confusion of concepts as the contrast between growth and limits wanes. Rather than setting biophysical limits, sustainability becomes a justification for continued growth ? green growth, sustainable mobility.},

We introduce this approach as a complementary approach to more traditional, and well-known, user-centered interaction design approaches. A concept-driven approach aims at manifesting theoretical concepts in concrete designs. A good concept design is both conceptually and historically grounded, bearing signs of the intended theoretical considerations. In the area of human–computer interaction and interaction design research, this approach has been quite popular but not necessarily explicitly recognized and developed as a proper research methodology. In this article, we demonstrate how a concept-driven approach can coexist, and be integrated with, common user-centered approaches to interaction design through the development of a model that makes explicit the existing cycle of prototyping, theory development, and user studies. We also present a set of basic principles that could constitute a foundation for concept driven interaction research, and we have considered and described the methodological implications given these principles. For the field of interaction design research we find this as an important point of departure for taking the next step toward the construction and verification of theoretical constructs that can help inform and guide future design research projects on novel interaction technologies.},

In this talk I suggest that contemporary computer musicking can play a similarly critical role in supporting us through contemporary existential, ecological, technological and social crises, by providing a space for reworking our relationships with each other and the world, including the technologies that we make. Framed by Gregory Bateson’s analysis of the fundamental epistemological error which leads to interrelated existential, social and ecological crises, I will draw upon a range of personal projects to illustrate the value of computer music practices in learning to think better: from cybernetic generative art, through ecosystemic evolutionary art and feedback musicianship to the need for interactive approaches to algorithm interpretation in ma- chine listening to biodiversity. I will illustrate how computer musicking can help in three ways: firstly by developing complexity literacy, helping us to better understand the complex systems of the anthropocene; secondly by providing a space to explore other modes of relation through learning to let others be; and thirdly to clarify the importance of aligning technologies with and not against, the biosphere. As pre-historic musicking made us human, so contemporary computer musicking can help us learn to think through the challenges we face today and be better humans tomorrow.{\textless}br{\textgreater}},

In Japanese, by contrast, financial terminology cannot be applied from a general vocabulary without further processing. In this study, we construct language models suitable for the financial domain. Furthermore, we compare methods for adapting language models to the financial domain, such as pre-training methods and vocabulary adaptation. We confirm that the adaptation of a pre-training corpus and tokenizer vocabulary based on a corpus of financial text is effective in several downstream financial tasks. No significant difference is observed between pre-training with the financial corpus and continuous pre-training from the general language model with the financial corpus.

In this paper, we study global additive explanations for non-additive models, focusing on four explanation methods: partial dependence, Shapley explanations adapted to a global setting, distilled additive explanations, and gradient-based explanations. We show that different explanation methods characterize non-additive components in a black-box model's prediction function in different ways. We use the concepts of main and total effects to anchor additive explanations, and quantitatively evaluate additive and non-additive explanations. Even though distilled explanations are generally the most accurate additive explanations, non-additive explanations such as tree explanations that explicitly model non-additive components tend to be even more accurate. Despite this, our user study showed that machine learning practitioners were better able to leverage additive explanations for various tasks. These considerations should be taken into account when considering which explanation to trust and use to explain black-box models.},

What crucial differences emerge in the way that their accounts? How do they take up and alter fundamental themes from the post-Kantian movement? There are a number of points of influence and critique between the two thinkers that play a generative role in their accounts of aesthetic experience: for example, their respective conceptions of mimesis, as well as the repression of mimesis in modern culture, their accounts of the fragmentary nature of truth, and their idea of constellational form.1 Many of these points of shared concern remain implicit in the accounts that I have given here. But in addition to these well-documented points of similarity between Benjamin and Adorno, they also engage in a debate on the nature of aesthetic experience, a debate founded not merely on differences in taste or politics but on fundamentally different epistemic views of aesthetic experience. Looking at the Benjamin–Adorno debate will help not only to reveal the context in which they influenced each other to devise their specific views. More importantly, it will help to reveal certain fundamental assumptions about how they regarded art as a form of social critique, and it will help to articulate the ways in which their respective philosophies respond to the influence of post-Kantian aesthetic thinking. I argue that the key difference between their accounts of aesthetic experience rests on the way that they think of art as a form of semblance (Schein) and in the way that they conceive of relationship between subject and object.},

	abstract = {What does a neural network encode about a concept as we traverse through the layers? Interpretability in machine learning is undoubtedly important, but the calculations of neural networks are very challenging to understand. Attempts to see inside their hidden layers can be misleading, unusable or rely on the latent space to possess properties that it may not have. Here, rather than attempting to analyse a neural network post hoc, we introduce a mechanism, called concept whitening (CW), to alter a given layer of the network to allow us to better understand the computation leading up to that layer. When a concept whitening module is added to a convolutional neural network, the latent space is whitened (that is, decorrelated and normalized) and the axes of the latent space are aligned with known concepts of interest. By experiment, we show that CW can provide us with a much clearer understanding of how the network gradually learns concepts over layers. CW is an alternative to a batch normalization layer in that it normalizes, and also decorrelates (whitens), the latent space. CW can be used in any layer of the network without hurting predictive performance.},

	shorttitle = {Composing {Electronic} {Music}},
	abstract = {Electronic music evokes new sensations, feelings, and thoughts in both composers and listeners. Opening the door to an unlimited universe of sound, it engages spatialization as an integral aspect of composition and focuses on sound transformation as a core structural strategy. In this new domain, pitch occurs as a flowing and ephemeral substance that can be bent, modulated, or dissolved into noise. Similarly, time occurs not merely as a fixed duration subdivided by ratios, but as a plastic medium that can be generated, modulated, reversed, warped, scrambled, and granulated. Envelope and waveform undulations on all time scales interweave to generate form. The power of algorithmic methods amplify the capabilities of music technology. Taken together, these constitute game-changing possibilities.  This convergence of technical and aesthetic trends prompts the need for a new text focused on the opportunities of a sound oriented, multiscale approach to composition of electronic music. Sound oriented means a practice that takes place in the presence of sound. Multiscale means an approach that takes into account the perceptual and physical reality of multiple, interacting time scales-each of which can be composed. After more than a century of research and development, now is an appropriate moment to step back and reevaluate all that has changed under the ground of artistic practice.  Composing Electronic Music outlines a new theory of composition based on the toolkit of electronic music techniques. The theory consists of a framework of concepts and a vocabulary of terms describing musical materials, their transformation, and their organization. Central to this discourse is the notion of narrative structure in composition-how sounds are born, interact, transform, and die. It presents a guidebook: a tour of facts, history, commentary, opinions, and pointers to interesting ideas and new possibilities to consider and explore.},

For example, to describe a musical note, one needs separate tokens to indicate the note’s pitch, duration, velocity (dynamics), and placement (onset time) along the time grid. While different types of tokens may possess different properties, existing models usually treat them equally, in the same way as modeling words in natural languages. In this paper, we present a conceptually different approach that explicitly takes into account the type of the tokens, such as note types and metric types. And, we propose a new Transformer decoder architecture that uses different feed-forward heads to model tokens of different types. With an expansion-compression trick, we convert a piece of music to a sequence of compound words by grouping neighboring tokens, greatly reducing the length of the token sequences. We show that the resulting model can be viewed as a learner over dynamic directed hypergraphs.

In the United Kingdom (UK),1 recent government policy places great value on the activities of support staff in the promotion of choice, control, and empowerment. The Care Act 2014 (UK Government, 2014) placed a duty on local authorities to promote an individual’s well-being, which includes ‘control by the individual over day-to-day life (including over care and support)’ and ‘participation in work, education, training or recreation’. In doing this, the authority must have regard for ‘the individual’s wishes, views, feelings or beliefs’, with the individual ‘participating as fully as possible in decisions … and being provided with the information and support necessary to enable the individual to participate’.},

We apply the concepts of space, place and communication space to the analysis of a corpus of interactions from an online community, ‘Walford’, which has a rich communicative ecology. A novel measure of sequential integration of conversational turns is proposed as an index of mutal-involvement.

We apply the concepts of space, place and communication space to the analysis of a corpus of interactions from an online community, ‘Walford’, which has a rich communicative ecology. A novel measure of sequential integration of conversational turns is proposed as an index of mutal-involvement. We demonstrate systematic differences in mutual-involvement that cannot be accounted for in terms of space or place and conclude that a concept of communication space is needed to address the organisation of human encounters in this community.},

Since recommender systems tend to optimize for personalized user experience, they can overlook impacts on cultural experience in the aggregate. After demonstrating that existing metrics do not center culture, we introduce a new metric, commonality, that measures the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. We developed commonality through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning public service media systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. We develop commonality as a measure of recommender system alignment with the promotion of content toward a shared cultural experience across a population of users. We empirically compare the performance of recommendation algorithms using commonality with existing metrics, demonstrating that commonality captures a novel property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics. Alongside existing fairness and diversity metrics, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing `public good' rationales for machine learning systems.},

	abstract = {In Karl Marx's critique of  political economy, commodity fetishism is the perception of the social relationships involved in production not as relationships among people, but as economic relationships among the money and commodities exchanged in market trade. As such, commodity fetishism transforms the subjective, abstract aspects of economic value into objective, real things that people believe have intrinsic value.The theory of commodity fetishism is presented in the first chapter of Das Kapital (English: Capital. Critique of Political Economy) (1867), at the conclusion of the analysis of the value-form of commodities, to explain that the social organization of labor is mediated through market exchange, the buying and the selling of commodities (goods and services). Hence, in a capitalist society, social relations between people—who makes what, who works for whom, the production-time for a commodity, et cetera—are perceived as economic relations among objects, that is, how valuable a given commodity is when compared to another commodity. Therefore, the market exchange of commodities obscures the true economic character of the human relations of production, between the worker and the capitalist.Marx explained the philosophic concepts underlying commodity fetishism thus:

As against this, the commodity-form, and the value-relation of the products of labour within which it appears, have absolutely no connection with the physical nature of the commodity and the material relations arising out of this. It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy we must take flight into the misty realm of religion. There the products of the human brain appear as autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into relations both with each other and with the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men's hands. I call this the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour as soon as they are produced as commodities, and is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.},

It is also inherently creative. Performers are called upon to interpret notated music, improvise new musical material, adapt to unexpected playing conditions, and accommodate technical errors. The focus of this paper is how creativity is distributed across members of a music ensemble as they perform these tasks. Some aspects of ensemble performance have been investigated extensively in recent years as part of the broader literature on joint action (e.g., the processes underlying sensorimotor synchronization). Much of this research has been done under highly controlled conditions, using tasks that generate reliable results, but capture only a small part of ensemble performance as it occurs naturalistically. Still missing from this literature is an explanation of how ensemble musicians perform in conditions that require creative interpretation, improvisation, and/or adaptation: how do they coordinate the production of something new? Current theories of creativity endorse the idea that dynamic interaction between individuals, their actions, and their social and material environments underlies creative performance. This framework is much in line with the embodied music cognition paradigm and the dynamical systems perspective on ensemble coordination. This review begins by situating the concept of collaborative musical creativity in the context of embodiment. Progress that has been made toward identifying the mechanisms that underlie collaborative creativity in music performance is then assessed. The focus is on the possible role of musical imagination in facilitating performer flexibility, and on the forms of communication that are likely to support the coordination of creative musical output. Next, emergence and group flow–constructs that seem to characterize ensemble performance at its peak–are considered, and some of the conditions that may encourage periods of emergence or flow are identified. Finally, it is argued that further research is needed to (1) demystify the constructs of emergence and group flow, clarifying their effects on performer experience and listener response, (2) determine how constrained musical imagination is by perceptual experience and understand people's capacity to depart from familiar frameworks and imagine new sounds and sound structures, and (3) assess the technological developments that are supposed to facilitate or enhance musical creativity, and determine what effect they have on the processes underlying creative collaboration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent developments in music technology and artiﬁcial intelligence have made these creative interactions applicable to the domain of computer music, meaning it is now possible to interface with algorithms as creative partners. The application of computational creativity research is beginning to be incorporated within the practice of live algorithmic music known as live coding. As music is inherently coupled with aﬀective response (often deﬁned as the general psychological state of an individual, including but not limited to emotions and mood), it is crucial for any artiﬁcial musical intelligence system to consider how to incorporate emotional meaning into collaborative musical actions. This work looks at bestowing live coding systems with the ability to autonomously create emotionally intelligent musical collaborations and examine new ways of interfacing with musical algorithms.},

We calibrated visual cognitive chunks with reading time in a user study, characterized the trade-off between cognitive load and accuracy for four datasets in simulation studies, and evaluated COGAM against baselines with users. We found that COGAM can decrease cognitive load without decreasing accuracy and/or increase accuracy without increasing cognitive load. Our framework and empirical measurement instruments for cognitive load will enable more rigorous assessment of the human interpretability of explainable AI.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that brain regions for mentalizing, including temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are activated in understanding the nonliteral meaning of sentences. A different set of brain regions, including left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), is activated for dealing with pragmatic incongruence. Here we demonstrate that individuals’ cognitive empathic ability modulates the brain activity underlying the processing of pragmatic constraints during sentence comprehension. The lian … dou … construction in Chinese (similar to English even) normally describes an event of low expectedness; it also introduces a pragmatic scale against which the likelihood of an underspecified event can be inferred. By embedding neutral or highly likely events in the construction, we created underspecified and incongruent sentences and compared both with control sentences in which events of low expectedness were described. Imaging results showed that (i) left TPJ was activated for the underspecified sentences, and the activity in mPFC correlated with individuals’ fantasizing ability and (ii) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was activated for the incongruent sentences, and the activity in bilateral IFG correlated with individuals’ perspective taking ability. These findings suggest that brain activations in making pragmatic inference and in dealing with pragmatic failure are modulated by different components of cognitive empathy.},

While one can potentially exploit the latent-space back-projection in GANs to cluster, we demonstrate that the cluster structure is not retained in the GAN latent space. In this paper, we propose ClusterGAN as a new mechanism for clustering using GANs. By sampling latent variables from a mixture of one-hot encoded variables and continuous latent variables, coupled with an inverse network (which projects the data to the latent space) trained jointly with a clustering specific loss, we are able to achieve clustering in the latent space. Our results show a remarkable phenomenon that GANs can preserve latent space interpolation across categories, even though the discriminator is never exposed to such vectors. We compare our results with various clustering baselines and demonstrate superior performance on both synthetic and real datasets.},

	abstract = {A rich set of interpretable dimensions has been shown to emerge in the latent space of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained for synthesizing images. In order to identify such latent dimensions for image editing, previous methods typically annotate a collection of synthesized samples and train linear classifiers in the latent space. However, they require a clear definition of the target attribute as well as the corresponding manual annotations, limiting their applications in practice. In this work, we examine the internal representation learned by GANs to reveal the underlying variation factors in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we take a closer look into the generation mechanism of GANs and further propose a closed-form factorization algorithm for latent semantic discovery by directly decomposing the pre-trained weights. With a lightning-fast implementation, our approach is capable of not only finding semantically meaningful dimensions comparably to the state-of-the-art supervised methods, but also resulting in far more versatile concepts across multiple GAN models trained on a wide range of datasets.},

	abstract = {Mainstream Audio Analytics models are trained to learn under the paradigm of one class label to many recordings focusing on one task. Learning under such restricted supervision limits the ﬂexibility of models because they require labeled audio for training and can only predict the predeﬁned categories. Instead, we propose to learn audio concepts from natural language supervision. We call our approach Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), which learns to connect language and audio by using two encoders and a contrastive learning to bring audio and text descriptions into a joint multimodal space. We trained CLAP with 128k audio and text pairs and evaluated it on 16 downstream tasks across 8 domains, such as Sound Event Classiﬁcation, Music tasks, and Speech-related tasks. Although CLAP was trained with signiﬁcantly less pairs than similar computer vision models, it establishes SoTA for Zero-Shot performance. Additionally, we evaluated CLAP in a supervised learning setup and achieve SoTA in 5 tasks. Hence, CLAP’s Zero-Shot capability removes the need of training with class labels, enables ﬂexible class prediction at inference time, and generalizes to multiple downstream tasks.},

This approach was trained with different songs of Handel. As a result, the system can represent the music in the latent space, and make accurate predictions. Therefore, the system can be used to compose new music either from an existing piece or from a random starting point. An additional feature of this system is that a small dataset was used for training. However, results show that the system is able to return accurate representations and predictions on unseen data.},

	abstract = {Chaotic signals are useful in two different levels in audio synthesis: as sound material or control structure. Patching languages such as Pd, Max/MSP, and jMAX provide easier mechanisms for generating chaotic structures at control level. We can generate deterministic chaotic signals either by finding numerical solutions to differential equations or by using first return maps. While generating the next sample, both of these methods require calculations with the knowledge of the previous sample. Most signal processing environments for computer music, such as Pd, Max/MSP, and jMAX, transfer audio data among their objects by vectors (blocks). In such environments, finding numerical solutions to differential equations or generating signals based on first return maps, will require writing external objects or setting the block-size to 1. Writing external objects can be time consuming and the real-time control of the calculations have to be embedded in the external object, which will require a recompilation for every change to the mechanism. Setting the block-size to 1 can make writing the patch cumbersome and sometimes very confusing. In this paper we shall present the fexpr\# object, implemented for Pd, Max/MSP, and jMAX, which can be used for finding numerical solutions to differential equations by simply entering the difference equations as part of the object arguments. The object parameters can then be controlled in real-time using the host patching language. As examples, solutions to Lorenz Equations, Chua's Oscillators, Duffing's equation, and the use of first return maps will be presented using the fexpr\# object.},

	url = {https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4kg8g9gd},
	abstract = {Artists, musicians, writers and designers use tools to be creative, whether they are designing a personal opus or producing work for hire. There are many more people who are neither paid professionals nor historic geniuses, but who also enjoy being creative in a casual way. Can we design systems to help these casual users engage with their creative sides?In this dissertation, I define and describe a genre of systems, "casual creators". Casual creators are interactive, generative systems in which the user explores a possibility space of artifacts, in a way that feels easy, pleasurable, and expressive. Casual creators do not provide the user with the total control of a "traditional" creativity tool like Maya or Photoshop. Instead, they empower the user with some combination of automation, generativity, surprise, or social/community features. Crucially, casual creators is not a genre of new systems, but a lens for looking at many existing (and emerging) systems that share these properties, including digital systems like Kid Pix and Spore, as well as non-digital systems like the Spirograph and Mad Libs.Contemporary creativity theory provides clues about where creativity happens (’environmental’ and ’embedded'; theories of creativity), and when creativity happens (’flow’ theory, improv). These theories have already been used to design creativity-augmentation systems in the field of creativity support tools and computational creativity. This dissertation combines these theories of creativity with theories of interactivity and generativity, to anticipate and catalog common patterns that can be seen when a user is creatively exploring a generative space.The dissertation concludes with an initial set of ten patterns, including patterns that emerge from technical aspects of the system’s design and others that emerge from the system’s position in a social environment. Along the way, a couple hundred systems that are casual creators in some way are noted and analyzed. The primary contribution of this dissertation is that the term "casual creators" (and its associated frameworks) has been shown useful for understanding existing and new systems, and that it has seeded a community of practice around such systems.},

They have been posited as a unique means of democratising creativity through the support of user exploration via system generativity, yet little is known about what casual creators are actually available to wider audiences. We conducted a qualitative analysis of currently available casual creators on the App Store. We found three categories of interaction techniques in widely available casual creators, which we describe in their exploration potential, feedback speed, and user autonomy.},

While normative habitual readings of marginalized people in HCI often highlight real problems, this work has been criticized for flattening heterogeneous experiences and overemphasizing harms. Some have advocated for expanding how we approach research on marginalized people (e.g., assets-based design, the everyday, and joy). Sensitized by unmaking literature, we explore this tension between conditions, experiences, and representations of marginality in HCI scholarship. To do so, we perform a diffractive analysis of posts in a gay online community by bringing two readings of the same data together: a normative habitual reading of marginalization and an expanded reading. By examining the relationship between empirical material and its representations by HCI researchers, we explore how to carefully unmake HCI research, thus maintaining and repairing our research community. We discuss the political and designerly implications of different readings of marginalized people and offer considerations for attending to the processes and afterlives of HCI research.},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges that autonomous vehicles (AVs) face in an urban setting is communicating with other road users such as pedestrians. In this work, we investigated with what expressive behaviors we can endow AVs such that pedestrians readily recognize the underlying intent of the vehicles’ movements. The purpose of our study was to test the impact of expressive stopping behaviors on pedestrians’ decision to cross a road. We utilized a virtual reality (VR) environment in which participants would have to cross a street in the presence of an oncoming vehicle that may or may not stop. Next, we crafted several expressive AV behaviors conveying its intention to stop for the pedestrian. Then, for each expressive design we recorded how quickly a pedestrian determined that it was safe to cross the street. We also administered repeated surveys of their subjective experiences. Our findings suggest that expressive behaviors such as easing into a full stop or stopping farther away can help pedestrians make quicker decisions to cross the road. Additionally, stopping farther away from the pedestrian also resulted in higher subjective experience for sense of safety, confidence, and intention understanding. We propose further investigation into expressive behaviors such as easing into a stop and stopping farther away to convey yielding intentions to pedestrians in future work.1},

Proceeding in two parts, this article explores the notion of de/coloniality and its emphasis on undoing legacies of colonialism and logics of race, before critiquing two major discontents of AI today: ethics as a colonial rationality and racializing dividing practices.

Placing the contours of the historiographical discussion of the Russian Revolution within a broader political context, I argue that Hobsbawm has underestimated the extent to which the standard academic accounts intentionally have marginalised Marxist interpretations. Hobsbawm\&apos;s own ambivalence toward the October Revolution and his lack of clarity on the origins of Stalinism are not supported by the latest empirical research and concede much ground to strident anti-Marxists. Rather than refuting the Marxist classics, new evidence from the archives of the former Soviet Union actually offers substantial support. The renewed academic attacks on the Russian Revolution, including the deliberate omission of evidence that support the Marxist interpretation, should be challenged rather than embraced by socialists.},

CAESynth synthesizes timbre in real-time by interpolating the reference sounds in their shared latent feature space, while controlling a pitch independently. We show that training a conditional autoen-coder based on accuracy in timbre classification together with adversarial regularization of pitch content allows timbre distribution in latent space to be more effective and stable for timbre interpolation and pitch conditioning. The proposed method is applicable not only to creation of musical cues but also to exploration of audio affordance in mixed reality based on novel timbre mixtures with environmental sounds. We demonstrate by experiments that CAESynth achieves smooth and high-fidelity audio synthesis in real-time through timbre interpolation and independent yet accurate pitch control for musical cues as well as for audio affordance with environmental sound. A Python implementation along with some generated samples are shared online.},

Beginning with discrete roles as composer and performer, our working relationship progressed naturally into one of equal authorship, and equal performative contribution. In exploring this creative relationship, we will examine the effects of working primarily with sound, over notation. We look at how building and extending our instruments affected the hybridity of our sound and contributed to the development of our musical language. We will analyse the importance of improvisation to our development as a duo, in the generation of ideas and the discovery of new sounds and potential in our instruments. This allowed us to retain a certain freedom when we returned to a loosely composed format to record our album. Over the course of this paper, we will examine the terms of our collaboration, with reference to other relevant work. We contextualise this collaboration with theoretical analysis and we reflect on the practicalities of our joint musical development and the growth of our musical partnership. The initial classically informed hierarchy of the composer/performer duo dissolved as we each took on a balanced creative and performative role.},

	abstract = {Traditional production frameworks and business models are now being challenged by alternatives that are informed by biology. The alternative paradigm, based on ecosystem models, argues that shifting from linear modes of production to a circular system can address material and energy efficiency by reducing the total volume of raw materials needed when manufacturing consumer products. This chapter introduces frameworks that apply closed-loop models at the product level namely; the Performance Economy, Cradle-to-CradleTM design, The Blue Economy and the Circular Economy.

We discuss the historic development of these ideas and their main contributions. Through the use of examples we explore both practical challenges associated with realising circular strategies as well as their business model implications. We conclude by highlighting some of the theoretical challenges associated with adopting closed-loop models advocating for a critical approach to sustainable resource management which includes circular strategies as part of a toolbox of options.},

Their actions and mechanisms no longer represent something, as traditionally studied in the field of semiotics, history, or art history, but actually do something: they produce various types of relationships and thus meanings in and outside the merely visual space. More concretely, they morph into “boundary images,” a concept that pays tribute to the work on WJT Mitchell and his interest in what pictures “want.” The boundary image can also refer to the broader definition of Susan Leigh Star and James R. Griesemer, for whom it is “an entity that links networks, elastic enough to be adapted to a new context and robust enough to keep its main characteristics” (p. 2). Boundary images are a subcategory of such boundary objects and are themselves capable of accepting new subcategories like “ontological boundary images,” which transgress the usual frontiers between the ontological domains of reality and fiction.},

In this paper, we describe our analysis of a dance and computing learning environment through the lens of distributed cognition to examine how representations and processing of information across people and systems impacted the learning process. We analyzed video and audio data from three workshops of dance and STEM instructors learning about, creating with, and co-designing computing activities with danceON—a creative computing platform that supports coding animations over dance videos. We identified the ways that the instructors used their bodies as a shared point of negotiation while co-creating dance artifacts, the participatory role of danceON within the sensemaking process, the ways that the instructors interpreted and translated representations across physical and digital spaces, and the impact of the instructors’ collaborative interactions to their sensemaking.},

The technology’s combined functionality of sampling, drum-programming and MIDI-sequencing has been embraced by practitioners since the release of the standalone MPC60 in 1988, until its more recent computer-dependent incarnations manifested in a multitude of current controllers and DAWs. The timeline coincides with particular sonic priorities in Hip-Hop that can be grouped under the ‘Boom Bap’ aesthetic - an onomatopoeic celebration of the prominence of sampled drum sounds programmed over sparse and heavily syncopated instrumentation. But what is the association between sub-genre aesthetics and MPC functionality, and what parallels can be drawn between the evolution of the technology and stylistic deviations in the genre? The chapter examines how MPC technology impacts upon the stylisation of Hip-Hop as a result of unique sonic, rhythmic and user-interface characteristics, which condition sampling, programming and mixing practices, determining recognisable sonic signatures. Furthermore, the Boom Bap sound is traced from its origins in the late 1980s to its current use as an East Coast production reference, honouring a sample-based philosophy that is facilitated by the MPCs’ physical interface and operating-system scripts. Utilising a two-fold methodology that combines musicological analysis with practice-led actualisation, the research explores a number of representative case studies, before investigating the interactivity of original composition and MPC workflow further. The findings form a systematic typology of technical characteristics correlated to creative approaches and resulting production traits, informing speculation on the future of the MPC, its technological descendants and the footprint of its aesthetic on emerging styles and technologies.

Those three compositions were created exclusively with materials from an extensive library of Indian music performances, curated and recorded by Blackburn specifically for Instruments INDIA, and premiered in concert in Liverpool, UK, 20 January 2017. Following the broader discussion of relevant concerns, we briefly review some perspectives offered by the three composers (one of whom is the author), as they relate to cultural appropriation in general, and working with the Instruments INDIA sound library in particular.},

Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne challenge everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success. Recognized as one of the most iconic and impactful strategy books ever written, Blue Ocean Strategy, now updated with fresh content from the authors, argues that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors but from creating “blue oceans”―untapped new market spaces ripe for growth.Blue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any organization can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. This expanded edition includes:A new preface by the authors: Help! My Ocean Is Turning RedUpdates on all cases and examples in the book, bringing their stories up to the present timeTwo new chapters and an expanded third one ― Alignment, Renewal, and Red Ocean Traps ― that address the most pressing questions readers have asked over the past 10 yearsA landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling book charts a bold new path to winning the future.

	abstract = {Forecasting physical functioning of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can inform timely clinical interventions and accurate “day planning” to improve their well-being. However, people’s physical functioning often remains unchecked in between infrequent clinical visits, leading to numerous negative healthcare outcomes. Existing Machine Learning (ML) models trained on in-situ data collected outside of clinical settings (e.g., in people’s homes) predict which people are currently experiencing low functioning. However, they do not forecast if and when people’s symptoms and behaviors will negatively impact their functioning in the future. Here, we present a computational behavior model that formalizes clinical knowledge about MS to forecast people’s end-of-day physical functioning in advance to support timely interventions. Our model outperformed existing ML baselines in a series of quantitative validation experiments. We showed that our model captured clinical knowledge about MS using qualitative visual model exploration in different “what-if” scenarios. Our work enables future behavior-aware interfaces that deliver just-in-time clinical interventions and aid in “day planning” and “activity pacing”.

BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Moreover, coordination sometimes emerges between musicians at the level of body sway (Chang et al., 2017). Our focus on gaze direction was motivated by the fact that gaze can serve simultaneously as a means of obtaining information about the world and as a means of communicating one's own attention and intent.},

	abstract = {This paper describes recent work on a large-scale, interactive dance theater performance entitled Schwelle as a platform to pose critical questions around the conception, design and implementation of what is commonly labeled responsive audio environments. The authors first discuss some principal issues in the design of responsive audio environments specifically within the domain of stage performance, addressing existing human-computer interaction paradigms in three key areas: sensing, mapping and data sonification. Next, we explore larger questions of composition in relation to these key areas, suggesting that potential strategies cross three different domains: mapping within algorithmic composition, data sonification techniques, and time-based evolutionary processes emerging from dynamical systems theory. We then examine recent work on Schwelle, which employs real time, distributed sensor data to drive a continuous dynamical system-based composition engine. The project’s conceptual and technical challenges are discussed as well as audience evaluation and feedback from the first presentation in Berlin in February 2007, and the subsequent revisions for the second presentation in Montréal in May 2007. Finally, the paper concludes with a set of issues that may act as a framework for future research focused on compositional strategies for larger scale, distributed, network-based sensor environments.},

Likewise, the author explores how autoethnography can offer musicians a means to reflect on their creative work in culturally insightful ways. To “play out” these disciplinary considerations, the author crafts an autoethnographic narrative that centers on her own creative practice as a conductor. Moving between description and action, dialogue and introspection, the narrative reveals some of the complexities of reflecting and writing about music in this way. While this narrative is grounded in the author’s lived experiences, it reveals significant broader issues about the process of doing autoethnography, the conducting profession, and the culture and practice of music-making at large.},

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

In this paper, I discuss live electronic musical improvisation as an exemplary model for the enactive framework in its ability to demonstrate the importance of participatory, relational, emergent, and embodied musical activities and processes. Following Gallagher, I argue that the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, where performers develop from novices to experts who may eventually achieve a state of ‘mindless flow’, does not adequately account for what can happen during various forms of musical play. A critical study of improvisation reveals that a more generous conception of meaningful musical activity is needed, particularly in terms of who is able to take part as an improviser. I contextualise these ideas from the position of being an improviser of live electronic music performed on self-built, hybrid analogue/digital instruments, my background in creating expressive musical systems for people with profound and complex learning difficulties, and through my recent explorations of both pedagogical and research approaches to interdisciplinary improvisation.},

	title = {Becoming {Lost} {Within} {Relational}, {Democratic} {Geographical} {Fieldwork} {Spaces}},
	abstract = {In the spirit of exploration and enquiry that is embodied within the discipline of geography, this thesis sets out on an adventure into 'terra incognita' to experiment with coming to know geographical fieldwork practices within a primary education context. This is a thesis about how children could be brought into relation with the world through a different kind of geography fieldwork .The current National Curriculum for geography in England (Department for Education (DfE), 2013) foregrounds a knowledge-rich curriculum that makes distinctions between the physical and human, seeking to introduce children and young people to the world as an 'object of thought' rather than as a 'place of experience' (Lambert, Rawling, Hopkin and Kinder, 2012:7). This thesis seeks to unsettle dominant discourses and works with the tensions and discomfort this causes to propose an expanded notion of geographical fieldwork that places relational thinking and understanding at the heart of the subject. Experimenting with posthumanist/new materialist possibilities for relational, democratic fieldwork I embrace an ethico-onto-epistemological stance that seeks to position geographers as 'becoming' within more-than-human assemblages. The thesis shares my commitment to thinking and doing geographical education research differently in these times of environmental crisis. It partially reveals the complexities and intricacies of encounters during a weekend residential geographical fieldwork event within the New Forest National Park around Minstead in Hampshire, United Kingdom in July 2017. It shares the happenings, beings and doings of 12 geography educators as they travel with ideas of place invitations. It follows the geographers' journeys as they attune and attend to more-than-human/human encounters experimenting with emergent pedagogies that foster surprise and uncertainty. Recent developments in post-qualitative research inspires messy methodologies that seek to disrupt 'research-as-usual' (Gannon, 2016:129). I work with 'getting lost' as a way of knowing (Lather, 2007) and the notion of 'productively failing' (Koro-Ljungberg, 2016a) to invite critical and creative practices to emerge as I 'befriend my data as an ontologically significant non-human' (Rautio, 2017:23). Inspired by Bennett's (2010) radical conception of materialism and matter and Barad's (2007) ideas of intra-action, I conceptualise fieldwork spaces as alive, inter-connected and in the process of formation. This is a collaborative, hopeful project of attunement, openness, attention and entanglement. A diffractive analysis (Mazzei, 2014:743) is employed to purposefully 'plug in' data/theory/practice from a wide range of fields to honour 'multiplicity, ambiguity' and seek new connections. Through relational stories, experimental writing/poetry and collage some of the geographers' sensory, embodied and affective encounters with stream, trees, bog, heath, ponies, fire, sticks, leaves, flowers and bracken are shared. Emerging from the thesis is the notion of fieldwork sites as lively and generative; meeting places for difference. Relational fieldwork is contingent, fluid and improvised in the moment. It fosters a pedagogical approach to geographical fieldwork through enchanting encounters with more-than-human elements that engages with ideas of equality, agency and democracy. A relational, enchanted geography entangles learners within a more-than-human community and offers possibilities to 'turn up the colour and tune in to the world' (Geoghegan and Woodyer 2014: 219) in order to rethink geographical fieldwork pedagogies.},

	abstract = {The physical and physiological development of infants and toddlers requires the proper amount of macronutrient intake, making it an essential problem to estimate the macronutrient in baby food. Nevertheless, existing solutions are either too expensive or poor performing, preventing the widespread use of automatic baby nutrient intake logging. To narrow this gap, this paper proposes a cost-effective and portable baby food macronutrient estimation system, BabyNutri. BabyNutri exploits a novel spectral reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct high-dimensional informative spectra from low-dimensional spectra, which are available from low-cost spectrometers. We propose a denoising autoencoder for the reconstruction process, by which BabyNutri can reconstruct a 160-dimensional spectrum from a 5-dimensional spectrum. Since the high-dimensional spectrum is rich in light absorption features of macronutrients, it can achieve more accurate macronutrient estimation. In addition, considering that baby food contains complex ingredients, we also design a CNN nutrition estimation model with good generalization performance over various types of baby food. Our extensive experiments over 88 types of baby food show that the spectral reconstruction error of BabyNutri is only 5.91\%, reducing 33\% than the state-of-the-art baseline with the same time complexity. In addition, the nutrient estimation performance of BabyNutri not only obviously outperforms state-of-the-art and cost-effective solutions but also is highly correlated with the professional spectrometer, with the correlation coefficients of 0.81, 0.88, 0.82 for protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. However the price of our system is only one percent of the commercial solution. We also validate that BabyNutri is robust regarding various factors, e.g., ambient light, food volume, and even unseen baby food samples.},

	abstract = {Many patients with neurological disorders, such as Ataxia, do not have easy access to neurologists, -especially those living in remote localities and developing/underdeveloped countries. Ataxia is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that surfaces as difficulty with motor control, such as walking imbalance. Previous studies have attempted automatic diagnosis of Ataxia with the help of wearable biomarkers, Kinect, and other sensors. These sensors, while accurate, do not scale efficiently well to naturalistic deployment settings. In this study, we propose a method for identifying ataxic symptoms by analyzing videos of participants walking down a hallway, captured with a standard monocular camera. In a collaboration with 11 medical sites located in 8 different states across the United States, we collected a dataset of 155 videos along with their severity rating from 89 participants (24 controls and 65 diagnosed with or are pre-manifest spinocerebellar ataxias). The participants performed the gait task of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). We develop a computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate the participants from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose coordinates to capture gait characteristics such as step width, step length, swing, stability, speed, etc. Our system is able to identify and track a patient in complex scenarios. For example, if there are multiple people present in the video or an interruption from a passerby. Our Ataxia risk-prediction model achieves 83.06\% accuracy and an 80.23\% F1 score. Similarly, our Ataxia severity-assessment model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.6225 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient score of 0.7268. Our model competitively performed when evaluated on data from medical sites not used during training. Through feature importance analysis, we found that our models associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability with greater Ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we are releasing the models and the body-pose coordinate dataset to the research community - the largest dataset on ataxic gait (to our knowledge). Our models could contribute to improving health access by enabling remote Ataxia assessment in non-clinical settings without requiring any sensors or special cameras. Our dataset will help the computer science community to analyze different characteristics of Ataxia and to develop better algorithms for diagnosing other movement disorders.},

We present a novel controllable system for generating single stems to accompany musical mixes of arbitrary length. At the core of our method are audio autoencoders that efficiently compress audio waveform samples into invertible latent representations, and a conditional latent diffusion model that takes as input the latent encoding of a mix and generates the latent encoding of a corresponding stem. To provide control over the timbre of generated samples, we introduce a technique to ground the latent space to a user-provided reference style during diffusion sampling. For further improving audio quality, we adapt classifier-free guidance to avoid distortions at high guidance strengths when generating an unbounded latent space. We train our model on a dataset of pairs of mixes and matching bass stems. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that, given an input mix, the proposed system can generate basslines with user-specified timbres. Our controllable conditional audio generation framework represents a significant step forward in creating generative AI tools to assist musicians in music production.},

We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

	abstract = {During the Baroque period, improvisation was a key element of music performance and education. Great musicians, such as J.S. Bach, were better known as improvisers than composers. Today, however, there is a lack of improvisation culture in classical music performance and education; classical musicians either are not trained to improvise, or cannot ﬁnd other people to improvise with. Motivated by this observation, we develop BachDuet, a system that enables real-time counterpoint improvisation between a human and a machine. This system uses a recurrent neural network to process the human musician’s monophonic performance on a MIDI keyboard and generates the machine’s monophonic performance in real time. We develop a GUI to visualize the generated music content and to facilitate this interaction. We conduct user studies with 13 musically trained users and show the feasibility of two-party duet counterpoint improvisation and the eﬀectiveness of BachDuet for this purpose. We also conduct listening tests with 48 participants and show that they cannot tell the diﬀerence between duets generated by human-machine improvisation using BachDuet and those generated by human-human improvisation. Objective evaluation is also conducted to assess the degree to which these improvisations adhere to common rules of counterpoint, showing promising results.},

Sound matching is one application of automatic programming, where the aim is to find the parameters for a synthesizer that cause it to emit as close a sound as possible to a target sound. We describe and compare several sound matching techniques that can be used to automatically program the Dexed synthesizer, which is a virtual model of a Yamaha DX7. The techniques are a hill climber, a genetic algorithm, and three deep neural networks that have not been applied to the problem before. We define a sound matching task based on six sets of sounds, which we derived from increasingly complex configurations of the Dexed synthesis algorithm. A bidirectional, long short-term memory network with highway layers performed better than any other technique and was able to match sounds closely in 25\% of the test cases. This network was also able to match sounds in near real time, once trained, which provides a significant speed advantage over previously reported techniques that are based on search heuristics. We also describe our open source framework, which makes it possible to repeat our study, and to adapt it to different synthesizers and algorithmic programming techniques.},

An important challenge in this field is to balance user control and autonomy in music generation systems. In this work, we present BassNet, a deep learning model for generating bass guitar tracks based on musical source material. An innovative aspect of our work is that the model is trained to learn a temporally stable two-dimensional latent space variable that offers interactive user control. We empirically show that the model can disentangle bass patterns that require sensitivity to harmony, instrument timbre, and rhythm. An ablation study reveals that this capability is because of the temporal stability constraint on latent space trajectories during training. We also demonstrate that models that are trained on pop/rock music learn a latent space that offers control over the diatonic characteristics of the output, among other things. Lastly, we present and discuss generated bass tracks for three different music fragments. The work that is presented here is a step toward the integration of AI-based technology in the workflow of musical content creators.},

He goes on to examine the former in terms of information processing (specifically, prototype approximation and non-habitual pattern recognition) and emotional involvement (especially of the endogenous reward and attachment systems). In the course of the book, Hogan examines such issues as how universal principles of aesthetic response may be reconciled with individual idiosyncrasy, how it is possible to argue rationally over aesthetic response, and what role personal beauty and sublimity might play in the definition of art. To treat these issues, the book considers works by Woolf, Wharton, Shakespeare, Arthur Miller, Beethoven, Matisse, and Kiran Rao, among others},

A major barrier is that consumers tend to resist new technologies that are considered alien or unproved, thus, policy decisions that consider their critical concerns will have a higher level of success. This research identiﬁes potential socio-technical barriers to consumer adoption of EVs and determines if sustainability issues inﬂuence consumer decision to purchase an EV. This study provides valuable insights into preferences and perceptions of technology enthusiasts; individuals highly connected to technology development and better equipped to sort out the many differences between EVs and CVs. This group of individuals will likely be early adopters of EVs only if they perceive them to be superior in performance compared to CVs. These results can guide policymakers in crafting energy and transportation policy. It can also provide guidance to EV engineers’ decision in incorporating consumer preference into EV engineering design.},

	abstract = {Texture synthesis techniques based on matching the Gram matrix of feature activations in neural networks have achieved spectacular success in the image domain. In this paper we extend these techniques to the audio domain. We demonstrate that synthesizing diverse audio textures is challenging, and argue that this is because audio data is relatively low-dimensional. We therefore introduce two new terms to the original Grammian loss: an autocorrelation term that preserves rhythm, and a diversity term that encourages the optimization procedure to synthesize unique textures. We quantitatively study the impact of our design choices on the quality of the synthesized audio by introducing an audio analogue to the Inception loss which we term the VGGish loss. We show that there is a trade-off between the diversity and quality of the synthesized audio using this technique. Finally we perform a number of experiments to qualitatively study how these design choices impact the quality of the synthesized audio.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. Despite the recent success, current LLMs are not capable of processing complex audio information or conducting spoken conversations (like Siri or Alexa). In this work, we propose a multi-modal AI system named AudioGPT, which complements LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) with 1) foundation models to process complex audio information and solve numerous understanding and generation tasks; and 2) the input/output interface (ASR, TTS) to support spoken dialogue. With an increasing demand to evaluate multi-modal LLMs of human intention understanding and cooperation with foundation models, we outline the principles and processes and test AudioGPT in terms of consistency, capability, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of AudioGPT in solving AI tasks with speech, music, sound, and talking head understanding and generation in multi-round dialogues, which empower humans to create rich and diverse audio content with unprecedented ease.

This black-box problem is especially concerning when the model makes decisions with consequences for human well-being. In response, an emerging field called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to increase the interpretability, fairness, and transparency of machine learning. In this paper, we describe how cognitive psychologists can make contributions to XAI. The human mind is also a black box, and cognitive psychologists have over 150 years of experience modeling it through experimentation. We ought to translate the methods and rigor of cognitive psychology to the study of artificial black boxes in the service of explainability. We provide a review of XAI for psychologists, arguing that current methods possess a blind spot that can be complemented by the experimental cognitive tradition. We also provide a framework for research in XAI, highlight exemplary cases of experimentation within XAI inspired by psychological science, and provide a tutorial on experimenting with machines. We end by noting the advantages of an experimental approach and invite other psychologists to conduct research in this exciting new field.},

In this paper, we present a novel method to structure the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to encode different continuous-valued attributes explicitly. This is accomplished by using an attribute regularization loss which enforces a monotonic relationship between the attribute values and the latent code of the dimension along which the attribute is to be encoded. Consequently, post-training, the model can be used to manipulate the attribute by simply changing the latent code of the corresponding regularized dimension. The results obtained from several quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the proposed method leads to disentangled and interpretable latent spaces that can be used to effectively manipulate a wide range of data attributes spanning image and symbolic music domains.},

	abstract = {Research through design is, by nature, embedded in the design process. In other words, while its main concern is to inform a research question, it also must be concerned with the end product of the design. As such, designers/researchers become concerned with the same type of “wicked problems” the professional designers are, especially when using research through design. Moreover, they also add a new layer of complications that are inherent to research. Since the approach is quickly gaining in popularity, it is necessary to develop a base of knowledge about it. Thus, this paper’s aim is to present a literature review of texts about research through design to demystify this approach and provide a deeper understanding for future work in the field. The gathered views on the subject are then classified into one of six sets of aspects: ontological aspects, epistemological aspects, methodological aspects, limits and expected contributions.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a growing concern in academia, industrial research laboratories and the mainstream commercial media about the phenomenon dubbed as machine bias, where trained statistical models—unbeknownst to their creators—grow to reflect controversial societal asymmetries, such as gender or racial bias. A significant number of Artificial Intelligence tools have recently been suggested to be harmfully biased toward some minority, with reports of racist criminal behavior predictors, Apple’s Iphone X failing to differentiate between two distinct Asian people and the now infamous case of Google photos’ mistakenly classifying black people as gorillas. Although a systematic study of such biases can be difficult, we believe that automated translation tools can be exploited through gender neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI.In this paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and used it in order to build sentences in constructions like “He/She is an Engineer” (where “Engineer” is replaced by the job position of interest) in 12 different gender neutral languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect statistics about the frequency of female, male and gender neutral pronouns in the translated output.We then show that Google Translate exhibits a strong tendency toward male defaults, in particular for fields typically associated to unbalanced gender distribution or stereotypes such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS’ data for the frequency of female participation in each job position, in which we show that Google Translate fails to reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers. In summary, we provide experimental evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal gender distribution, Google Translate yields male defaults much more frequently than what would be expected from demographic data alone. We believe that our study can shed further light on the phenomenon of machine bias and are hopeful that it will ignite a debate about the need to augment current statistical translation tools with debiasing techniques—which can already be found in the scientific literature.},

	abstract = {Selective manipulation of data attributes using deep generative models is an active area of research. In this paper, we present a novel method to structure the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to encode different continuous-valued attributes explicitly. This is accomplished by using an attribute regularization loss which enforces a monotonic relationship between the attribute values and the latent code of the dimension along which the attribute is to be encoded. Consequently, post-training, the model can be used to manipulate the attribute by simply changing the latent code of the corresponding regularized dimension. The results obtained from several quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the proposed method leads to disentangled and interpretable latent spaces that can be used to effectively manipulate a wide range of data attributes spanning image and symbolic music domains.},

Situating her study midway between the 1917 Bolshevik revolution and the peak of the Stalinist purges of 1937, she explains that the value of this type of multi-faceted investigation is twofold. On the one hand, Soviet theories on architectural design incorporated contemporaneous psychological and physiological studies of human life. On the other, the Soviet movement was developed from and integrated with the formation of an international modernism.},

Examples of studies from a wide range of disciplines illustrate the strengths, limitations, and applications of the primary qualitative methods: in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, ethnography, content analysis, and case study and narrative research. Following a consistent format, chapters show students and researchers how to implement each method within a paradigm-neutral and flexible Total Quality Framework (TQF) comprising four interrelated components: Credibility, Analyzability, Transparency, and Usefulness. Unlike other texts that relegate quality issues to one or two chapters, detailed discussions of such crucial topics as construct validity, interresearcher reliability, researcher bias, and verification strategies are featured throughout. The book also addresses applications of the TQF to the writing, review, and evaluation of qualitative research proposals and manuscripts. Pedagogical Features *Summary tables that highlight important content, such as the application of a method to vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. *Case studies that illustrate TQF standards in practice for each method. *Guidelines for effective documentation (via thick descriptions) of each type of study. *End-of-chapter discussion topics, exercises, and suggested further reading and Web resources. *Chapters open with a preview and close with a bulleted summary of key ideas. *Extensive glossary.},

Articulating the nuances, complexity, and diversity of a user's experience beyond surface descriptions remains a challenge within design. One qualitative method — micro-phenomenology — has been used in HCI/Design research since 2001. Yet, no systematic understanding of micro-phenomenology has been presented, particularly from the perspective of HCI/Design researchers who actively use it in design contexts. We interviewed 5 HCI/Design experts who utilize micro-phenomenology and present their experiences with the method. We illustrate how this method has been applied by the selected experts through developing a practice, and present conditions under which the descriptions of the experience unfold, and the values that this method can provide to HCI/Design field. Our contribution highlights the value of micro-phenomenology in articulating the experience of designers and participants, developing vocabulary for multi-sensory experiences, and unfolding embodied tacit knowledge.},

Il s’agit de créer de nouveaux paradigmes d’interaction qui offrent à l’utilisateur de plus amples possibilités d’expression basées sur le geste. Un des vecteurs d’expression du geste, très rarement traité en Interaction Homme Machine, qui lui confère sa coloration et son aspect, est ce que les théoriciens et praticiens de la danse appellent « les qualités de mouvement ». Nous mettons à profit des collaborations avec le domaine de la danse pour étudier la notion de qualités de mouvement et l’intégrer à des paradigmes d’interaction gestuelle. Notre travail analyse les apports de l’intégration des qualités de mouvement comme modalité d’interaction, fournit les outils propices à l’élaboration de cette intégration (en termes de méthodes d’analyse, de visualisation et de contrôle gestuel), en développe et évalue certaines techniques d’interaction.Les contributions de la thèse se situent d’abord dans la formalisation de la notion de qualités de mouvement et l’évaluation de son intégration dans un dispositif interactif en termes d’expérience utilisateur. Sur le plan de la visualisation des qualités de mouvement, les travaux menés pendant la thèse ont permis de démontrer que les modèles physiques masses-ressorts offrent de grandes possibilités de simulation de comportements dynamiques et de contrôle en temps réel. Sur le plan de l’analyse, la thèse a permis de développer des approches novatrices de reconnaissance automatique des qualités de mouvement de l’utilisateur. Enfin, à partir des approches d’analyse et de visualisation des qualités de mouvement, la thèse a donné lieu à l’implémentation d’un ensemble de techniques d’interaction. Elle a appliqué et évalué ses techniques dans le contexte de la pédagogie de la danse et de la performance.},

	abstract = {Analysing electroacoustic music is a challenging task that can be approached by different strategies. In the last few decades, newly emerging computer environments have enabled analysts to examine the sound spectrum content in greater detail. This has resulted in new graphical representation of features extracted from audio recordings. In this article, we propose the use of representations from complex dynamical systems such as phase space graphics in musical analysis to reveal emergent timbre features in granular technique-based acousmatic music. It is known that granular techniques applied to musical composition generate considerable sound flux, regardless of the adopted procedures and available technological equipment. We investigate points of convergence between different aesthetics of the so-called Granular Paradigm in electroacoustic music, and consider compositions employing different methods and techniques. We analyse three works: Concret PH (1958) by Iannis Xenakis, Riverrun (1986) by Barry Truax, and Schall (1996) by Horacio Vaggione. In our analytical methodology, we apply such concepts as volume and emergence, as well as their graphical representation to the pieces. In conclusion we compare our results and discuss how they relate to the three composers’ specific procedures creating sound flux as well as to their compositional epistemologies and ontologies.},

Some research has been conducted into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to overcome the limitation of the black-box nature of AI methods. Compared with AI techniques such as deep learning, XAI can provide both decision-making and explanations of the model. In this review, we conducted a survey of the recent trends in medical diagnosis and surgical applications using XAI. We have searched articles published between 2019 and 2021 from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery, and Google Scholar. We included articles which met the selection criteria in the review and then extracted and analyzed relevant information from the studies. Additionally, we provide an experimental showcase on breast cancer diagnosis, and illustrate how XAI can be applied in medical XAI applications. Finally, we summarize the XAI methods utilized in the medical XAI applications, the challenges that the researchers have met, and discuss the future research directions. The survey result indicates that medical XAI is a promising research direction, and this study aims to serve as a reference to medical experts and AI scientists when designing medical XAI applications.},

The first part is focused on the notion of the audible ecosystem and its theoretical counterpart, the idea of emergent sound structures. With this last idea, higher levels of a musical work (for instance, the macroform itself) appear as an emergence from lower levels. As for the notion of the audible ecosystem—analyzed here through the live electronics solos named Audible Ecosystemics—this is achieved through interaction between the performer, the electronics and the environment. In its second part, the paper tries to define an analytic image of the resultant sounds of the audible ecosystems. To do so, we use the concept of imprint (empreinte in French) as it is analyzed by Georges Didi-Huberman. Then, we go back to musical analysis and argue that a musical analysis of Agostino Di Scipio's audible ecosystems involves an analysis of the relationships between what we have listened to, what we can only imagine and the compositional techniques themselves. Before concluding, the article shows an example of this way of analyzing by taking a sample at random from the piece Audible Ecosystemics 3b.},

They also call themselves ‘those whosuspend’ (ephektikoi), thereby signaling that theirinvestigations lead them to suspension of judgment. They do not putforward theories, and they do not deny that knowledge can be found. Atits core, ancient skepticism is a way of life devoted toinquiry. Also, it is as much concerned with belief as withknowledge. As long as knowledge has not been attained, the skepticsaim not to affirm anything. This gives rise to their mostcontroversial ambition: a life without belief., Ancient skepticism is, for the most part, a phenomenon ofPost-Classical, Hellenistic philosophy. The Academic and Pyrrhonianskeptical movements begin roughly in the third century BCE, and endwith Sextus Empiricus in the second century CE. Hellenistic philosophyis a large-scale conversation, not unlike philosophy today. Theskeptics (among them Pyrrho, Timon, Arcesilaus, Carneades,Aenesidemus, and Sextus Empiricus) do engage with Pre-Socraticphilosophy, Socrates, Protagorean relativism, Plato, and perhapsAristotle. But their contemporary and principal interlocutors areEpicureans, Stoics, Cynics, and Megarian logicians (cf. Long 2006,ch. 4 and 5).},

	abstract = {This article takes as a touchstone the concept of location as it has been articulated through anthropology's reflections on its history and positioning as a field, and in relation to shifting engagements with contemporary technoscientific, political, and ethical problems. A second touchstone is one specific anthropological relocation—that is, into worlds of professional technology design. With figures of location and design in play, I describe some perspicuous moments that proved both generative and problematic in my own experience of establishing terms of engagement between anthropology and design. Though design has been considered recently as a model for anthropology's future, I argue instead that it is best positioned as a problematic object for an anthropology of the contemporary. In writing about design's limits, my argument is that, like anthropology, design needs to acknowledge the specificities of its place, to locate itself as one (albeit multiple) figure and practice of transformation.},

	abstract = {Activity recognition using video data is widely adopted for elder care, monitoring for safety and security, and home automation. Unfortunately, using video data as the basis for activity recognition can be brittle, since models trained on video are often not robust to certain environmental changes, such as camera angle and lighting changes. There has been a proliferation of network-connected devices in home environments. Interactions with these smart devices are associated with network activity, making network data a potential source for recognizing these device interactions. This paper advocates for the synthesis of video and network data for robust interaction recognition in connected environments. We consider machine learning-based approaches for activity recognition, where each labeled activity is associated with both a video capture and an accompanying network traffic trace. We develop a simple but effective framework AMIR (Active Multimodal Interaction Recognition)1 that trains independent models for video and network activity recognition respectively, and subsequently combines the predictions from these models using a meta-learning framework. Whether in lab or at home, this approach reduces the amount of "paired" demonstrations needed to perform accurate activity recognition, where both network and video data are collected simultaneously. Specifically, the method we have developed requires up to 70.83\% fewer samples to achieve 85\% F1 score than random data collection, and improves accuracy by 17.76\% given the same number of samples.},

However, this fundamental aspect of communicating is mostly omitted in 3D social forums or virtual world oriented games. This paper proposes an answer by presenting a multi-user 3D-chatting system enriched with NVC relative to motion. This event-based architecture tries to recreate a context by extracting emotional cues from dialogs and derives virtual human potential body expressions from that event triggered context model. We structure the paper by expounding the system architecture enabling the modeling NVC in a multi-user 3D-chatting environment. There, we present the transition from dialog-based emotional cues to body language, and the management of NVC events in the context of a virtual reality client-server system. Finally, we illustrate the results with graphical scenes and a statistical analysis representing the increase of events due to NVC.},

The traditional Russellian analysis holds that definite descriptions are quantifiers which contribute uniqueness conditions to propositions. This view renders all tokens of incomplete definite descriptions false. There are two general strategies for maintaining the quantificational analysis; one is to treat definite descriptions as containing hidden indexicals and the other is to concede their non-denoting nature (and thus the falsehood of their tokens). It is argued that the former ‘semantic’ strategies lead to overgeneration while the latter ‘pragmatic’ strategies share with their semantic counterparts the mistaken claims that when someone speaks, something unique, and exclusively determined by context of utterance, is expressed. Once these errors are revealed, incomplete definite descriptions are shown to pose no problem for the quantificational analysis.},

Boole considers language not just as a mode of expression, but as a system one can use to understand the human mind. In the first 12 chapters, he sets down the rules necessary to represent logic in this unique way. Then he analyses a variety of arguments and propositions of various writers from Aristotle to Spinoza.

Creating and specializing DNNs from scratch has grown increasingly difficult as state-of-the-art architectures grow more complex. Following the path of traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers have begun to reuse large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and fine-tune these models for downstream tasks. Prior works have studied reuse practices for traditional software packages to guide software engineers towards better package maintenance and dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of knowledge to guide behaviors in pre-trained model ecosystems. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of PTM reuse. We interviewed 12 practitioners from the most popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face, to learn the practices and challenges of PTM reuse. From this data, we model the decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified practices, we describe useful attributes for model reuse, including provenance, reproducibility, and portability. Three challenges for PTM reuse are missing attributes, discrepancies between claimed and actual performance, and model risks. We substantiate these identified challenges with systematic measurements in the Hugging Face ecosystem. Our work informs future directions on optimizing deep learning ecosystems by automated measuring useful attributes and potential attacks, and envision future research on infrastructure and standardization for model registries.},

In doing so, it brings together conceptual frameworks that govern the running of Living Labs with cyclical processes of innovation moments, both within the context of Multi-level Perspective on Geographically-bound Sectoral Systems of Innovation. In sum, this paper is advancing a view, that high-tech networked R\&D processes can be described as management of innovation moments within loose Living Labs configurations of partners. This is termed as Open Engineering – combining organisational learning principles with Open Innovation management.},

	abstract = {Research into machine listening has intensified in recent years creating a variety of techniques for recognising musical features suitable, for example, in musicological analysis or commercial application in song recognition. Within NIME, several projects exist seeking to make these techniques useful in real-time music making. However, we debate whether the functionally-oriented approaches inherited from engineering domains that much machine listening research manifests is fully suited to the exploratory, divergent, boundary-stretching, uncertainty-seeking, playful and irreverent orientations of many artists. To explore this, we engaged in a concerted collaborative design exercise in which many different listening algorithms were implemented and presented with input which challenged their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality which research can take for granted. An immersive 3D spatialised multichannel environment was created in which the algorithms could be explored in a hybrid installation/performance/lecture form of research presentation. The paper closes with reflections on the creative value of ‘hijacking’ formal approaches into deviant contexts, the typically undocumented practical know-how required to make algorithms work, the productivity of a playfully irreverent relationship between engineering and artistic approaches to NIME, and a sketch of a sonocybernetic aesthetics for our work.},

The under-representation of women, African-American and Latinx professionals in the IT workforce is a longstanding issue that contributes to and is impacted by algorithmic bias. Design/methodology/approach Sources of algorithmic bias in talent acquisition software are presented. Feminist design thinking is presented as a theoretical lens for mitigating algorithmic bias. Findings Data are just one tool for recruiters to use; human expertise is still necessary. Even well-intentioned algorithms are not neutral and should be audited for morally and legally unacceptable decisions. Feminist design thinking provides a theoretical framework for considering equity in the hiring decisions made by talent acquisition systems and their users. Social implications This research implies that algorithms may serve to codify deep-seated biases, making IT work environments just as homogeneous as they are currently. If bias exists in talent acquisition software, the potential for propagating inequity and harm is far more significant and widespread due to the homogeneity of the specialists creating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Originality/value This work uses equity as a central concept for considering algorithmic bias in talent acquisition. Feminist design thinking provides a framework for fostering a richer understanding of what fairness means and evaluating how AI software might impact marginalized populations.},

But their decision-making processes are often opaque-it is difficult to explain why a certain decision was made. We develop a formal foundation to improve the transparency of such decision-making systems. Specifically, we introduce a family of Quantitative Input Influence (QII) measures that capture the degree of influence of inputs on outputs of systems. These measures provide a foundation for the design of transparency reports that accompany system decisions (e.g., explaining a specific credit decision) and for testing tools useful for internal and external oversight (e.g., to detect algorithmic discrimination). Distinctively, our causal QII measures carefully account for correlated inputs while measuring influence. They support a general class of transparency queries and can, in particular, explain decisions about individuals (e.g., a loan decision) and groups (e.g., disparate impact based on gender). Finally, since single inputs may not always have high influence, the QII measures also quantify the joint influence of a set of inputs (e.g., age and income) on outcomes (e.g. loan decisions) and the marginal influence of individual inputs within such a set (e.g., income). Since a single input may be part of multiple influential sets, the average marginal influence of the input is computed using principled aggregation measures, such as the Shapley value, previously applied to measure influence in voting. Further, since transparency reports could compromise privacy, we explore the transparency-privacy tradeoff and prove that a number of useful transparency reports can be made differentially private with very little addition of noise. Our empirical validation with standard machine learning algorithms demonstrates that QII measures are a useful transparency mechanism when black box access to the learning system is available. In particular, they provide better explanations than standard associative measures for a host of scenarios that we consider. Further, we show that in the situations we consider, QII is efficiently approximable and can be made differentially private while preserving accuracy.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there is a growing use of algorithmic law enforcement by online intermediaries. Algorithmic enforcement by private intermediaries is located at the interface between public law and private ordering. It often reflects risk management and commercial interests of online intermediaries, effectively converging law enforcement and adjudication powers, at the hands of a small number of mega platforms. At the same time, algorithmic governance also plays a critical role in shaping access to online content and facilitating public discourse. Yet, online intermediaries are hardly held accountable for algorithmic enforcement, even though they may reach erroneous decisions. Developing proper accountability mechanisms is hence vital to create a check on algorithmic enforcement. Accordingly, relying on lessons drawn from algorithmic copyright enforcement by online intermediaries, this chapter demonstrates the accountability deficiencies in algorithmic copyright enforcement; maps the barriers for algorithmic accountability and discusses various strategies for enhancing accountability in algorithmic governance.},

What is the immediately detectable difference between the allegory in the Commedia and that of the traditional allegorical-didactic poems? What kind of allegory did Dante have in mind when writing the Commedia? This article is my contribution to a possible solution of this problem. My assumption is that Dante wanted to give the Commedia a complex polysemous structure: a structure that, in a new and original way, unites the two traditional medieval forms of allegory, the poetical and the theological (according to Dante's own terminology in Convivio“allegory of the theologians” and “allegory of the poets”). The article is divided into four parts: first a synthetic presentation of the concept of allegory; an analysis of the most important passages where Dante treats the problem theoretically (this includes especially some passages from Convivio, and the much discussed Epistle XIII); a discussion of some of the most important positions within the Dante research; and finally a possible solution to the problem.},

Here, as home-embedded sensors passively monitor a free person, good inferences happen randomly. The inferences' confidence highly depends on how congruent her momentary conditions are to the conditions favored by the AI models, e.g., front-facing or unobstructed. We envision new strategies of AI-to-Human Actuation (AHA) that empower the sensory AIs with proactive actuation so that they induce the person's conditions to be more favorable to the AIs. In this light, we explore the initial feasibility and efficacy of AHA in the context of home-embedded visual AIs. We build a taxonomy of actuations that could be issued to home residents to benefit visual AIs. We deploy AHA in an actual home rich in sensors and interactive devices. With 20 participants, we comprehensively study their experiences with proactive actuation blended with their usual home routines. We also demonstrate the substantially improved inferences of the actuation-empowered AIs over the passive sensing baseline. This paper sets forth an initial step towards interweaving human-targeted AIs and proactive actuation to yield more chances for high-confidence inferences without sophisticating the model, in order to improve robustness against unfavorable conditions.},

We identify what types of non-verbal communication cues road users use at the point of crossing, their responses, and under what circumstances the crossing event takes place. It was found that in more than 90\% of the cases pedestrians gaze at the approaching cars prior to crossing in non-signalized crosswalks. The crossing action, however, depends on additional factors such as time to collision, explicit driver's reaction or structure of the crosswalk.},

We discuss some of the key analyses of affordances in HCI research and make three related claims. First, we argue that many current interpretations of the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second, we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances, conceptualized as interaction between animals and their environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson's ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational property of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment. We conclude with a discussion of prospects for future conceptual and empirical explorations of the meditational perspective in HCI research.},

We evaluate our trained language model, called AgriBERT, on the task of semantic matching, i.e., establishing mapping between food descriptions and nutrition data, which is a long-standing challenge in the agricultural domain. In particular, we formulate the task as an answer selection problem, fine-tune the trained language model with the help of an external source of knowledge (e.g., FoodOn ontology), and establish a baseline for this task. The experimental results reveal that our language model substantially outperforms other language models and baselines in the task of matching food description and nutrition.},

Representative examples of each type are briefly described. Then, we look in more detail at the problem of endowing the resulting performances with the expressiveness that characterizes human-generated music. This is one of the most challenging aspects of computer music that has been addressed just recently. The main problem in modeling expressiveness is to grasp the performer's "touch," that is, the knowledge applied when performing a score. Humans acquire it through a long process of observation and imitation. For this reason, previous approaches, based on following musical rules trying to capture interpretation knowledge, had serious limitations. An alternative approach, much closer to the observation-imitation process observed in humans, is that of directly using the interpretation knowledge implicit in examples extracted from recordings of human performers instead of trying to make explicit such knowledge. In the last part of the article, we report on a performance system, SAXEX, based on this alternative approach, that is capable of generating high-quality expressive solo performances of jazz ballads based on examples of human performers within a case-based reasoning (CBR) system.},

	abstract = {Dynamic scores have gained popularity as an innovative intervention in musical performance, providing novelty for both performers and audiences. In this paper, we discuss agential scores and the implications of their emergent, selforganising, and entanglement affordances for musical performance ecologies. We approach this through practicebased research, introducing To¨lvera, an artificial life software library for agential scores. We propose a typology of interaction scenarios for agential scores and investigate a subset of these, presenting the outcomes of early artistic encounters with To¨lvera between two improvising guitarists. Reflecting on our experiences, we emphasise the unique challenges that emerge from engaging with scores as real-time agents, suggesting that agential scores promote fluidity of form in notation, which consequently prompts performers to identify with, mirror, and attune to them. Although scores have always possessed agency, we argue that a more explicit and practical focus on agency raises new questions and offers new possibilities for the intraactions between human and non-human agents within musical ecologies.},

He emphasises the natural basis of responses of various kinds without which aesthetic terms could not be learned, such as similarities of various sorts, notable colours, shapes, scents, size, and intricacy. Such natural responses enable us not only to learn aesthetic terms often by a metaphorical shift, but are also used subsequently to evaluate and illuminate works of art. It is in this sense that critics reinforce the relation between aesthetic terms and their natural bases.},

Drawing on twenty-five years’ experience of leading or facilitating action research projects, Bridget Somekh argues that action research can be a powerful systematic intervention, which goes beyond describing, analyzing and theorizing practices to reconstruct and transform those practices. The book examines action research into change in a range of educational settings, such as schools and classrooms, university departments, and a national evaluation of technology in schools. The opening chapter presents eight methodological principles and discusses key methodological issues. The focus then turns to action research in broader contexts such as ‘southern’ countries, health, business and management, and community development. Each chapter thereafter takes a specific research project as its starting point and critically reviews its design, relationships, knowledge outcomes, political engagement and impact.Action Research is important reading for postgraduate students and practitioner researchers in education, health and management, as well as those in government agencies and charities who wish to research and evaluate change and development initiatives. It is also valuable for pre-service and in-service training of professionals such as teachers, nurses and managers.},

Upon selecting a subset of synthesis parameters, the system automatically finds the parameters-to-sound deterministic relationship in a multidimensional space. We analyze this sonic space using two different unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques and we build the mapping using statistical information on a lower, but maximally representative, number of dimensions. The result is an adaptation of any generalpurpose interface to a specific synthesis engine, providing control directly over the perceptual features with greatest variance. This approach guarantees a linear relationship between control signals and perceptual features, and at the same time, reduces the control space dimensionality maintaining the maximum explorability of the sonic space.},

It is reminiscent of the old, traditional tensions at the heart of the social sciences, such as those between agency and structure or micro- and macro-analysis. Yet, ANT, also known as the sociology of translation, is not just another attempt to show the artificial or dialectical nature of these classical oppositions. On the contrary, its purpose is to show how they are constructed and to provide tools for analyzing that process. One of the core assumptions of ANT is that what the social sciences usually call ‘society’ is an ongoing achievement. ANT is an attempt to provide analytical tools for explaining the very process by which society is constantly reconfigured. What distinguishes it from other constructivist approaches is its explanation of society in the making, in which science and technology play a key part.},

The experiment uses 365 music clips in the PMEmo data set, and after manual labeling, they are divided into four groups: HAPPY, SAD, ANGRY and RELAX according to the Thayer emotion model and the classification effect is judged by comparing F1-measure. Experiments show that active learning can reduce the need for manual labeling by about 78\%, and it can help to achieve better results with fewer labels. At the same time, among the three simple classifiers, the SVM model and active learning have a better degree of adaptation in the field of music emotion recognition.},

In this work, we exploit this linguistic overlap to facilitate translating to and from a low-resource language with only monolingual data, in addition to any parallel data in the related high-resource language. Our method, NMT-Adapt, combines denoising autoencoding, back-translation and adversarial objectives to utilize monolingual data for low-resource adaptation. We experiment on 7 languages from three different language families and show that our technique significantly improves translation into low-resource language compared to other translation baselines.},

	abstract = {We propose a method to adapt multilingual Machine Translation models to a low resource language (LRL) that was not included during the pre-training/training phases. We utilize data from a closely related High resource language (HRL) to fine-tune the model. Along with that use neuron-ranking analysis to select neurons that are most influential to the high resource language (HRL) and fine-tune only this subset of the deep neural network’s neurons. We experiment with three mechanisms to compute such ranking. To allow for the potential difference in writing scripts between the HRL and LRL we utilize an alignment model to substitute HRL elements of the predefined vocab with appropriate LRL ones. In our experiments our method improves on both zero-shot and the stronger baseline of directly fine-tuning the MBART50 model on the low-resource data by 3 BLEU points in T ajik → English and 1.6 BLEU points in English → T ajik using Persian as the closest HRL on the FLORES101 devtest test set. We also show that as we simulate smaller data amounts, the gap between our method and direct fine-tuning continues to widen.},

This lack of temporal attunement risks obscuring important contextual knowledge, hidden labour, material agencies and potential knowledge contributions. We turn to the notion of the event to articulate the granularities and nuances of RtD processes with an expanded vocabulary. We draw on prior calls from RtD practitioners, the philosophical roots of events, and our previous work with the term in our own research. We describe seven terms to expand the temporal vocabulary of RtD, which can be used to build narratives that emphasize knowledge created along the way, and relieve pressure from the ‘final’ artifact. Our contributions are 1) design events as an ontological shift and analytical tool and 2) a vocabulary that scaffolds design events as a sensitizing tool. We end with a call for more experimentation of non-chronological narratives of RtD.},

This automation commonly comes in the form of smart home routines, an abstraction available via major vendors. Yet, questions remain about how a system should best handle conflicts in which different routines access the same devices simultaneously. In particular---among the myriad ways a smart home system could handle conflicts, which of them are currently utilized by existing systems, and which ones result in the highest user satisfaction? We investigate the first question via a survey of existing literature and find a set of conditions, modifications, and system strategies related to handling conflicts. We answer the second question via a scenario-based Mechanical-Turk survey of users interested in owning smart home devices and current smart home device owners (N=197). We find that: (i) there is no context-agnostic strategy that always results in high user satisfaction, and (ii) users' personal values frequently form the basis for shaping their expectations of how routines should execute.},

The model is inspired by the fact that when humans listen to music, our minds can not only separate the sounds of different instruments, but also at the same time perceive high-level representations such as score and timbre. To mirror such capability computationally, we designed a pitch-timbre disentanglement module based on a popular encoder-decoder neural architecture for source separation. The key inductive biases are vector-quantization for pitch representation and pitch-transformation invariant for timbre representation. In addition, we adopted a query-by-example method to achieve {\textbackslash}textit\{zero-shot\} learning, i.e., the model is capable of doing source separation, transcription, and synthesis for {\textbackslash}textit\{unseen\} instruments. The current design focuses on audio mixtures of two monophonic instruments. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing multi-task baselines, and the transcribed score serves as a powerful auxiliary for separation tasks.},

Furthermore, we discuss the possible implementations and accessibility of a set of currently available AI solutions, as aids to musical composition. Our research shows how publications are being distributed globally according to many characteristics, which provides a clear picture of the situation of this technology. Through our research it becomes clear that the interest of both musicians and computer scientists in AI-based automatic music generation has increased significantly in the last few years with an increasing participation of mayor companies in the field whose works we analyze. We discuss several generation architectures, both from a technical and a musical point of view and we highlight various areas were further research is needed.},

Specifically, this work first briefly introduces the background of audio and diffusion model. As for the text-to-speech task, we divide the methods into three categories based on the stage where diffusion model is adopted: acoustic model, vocoder and end-to-end framework. Moreover, we categorize various speech enhancement tasks by either certain signals are removed or added into the input speech.

	abstract = {Hip-hop producers rely on several specific formulas to create sample-based hip-hop. Developed with a combination of analysis and ethnography, this typology of sampling is a systematic terminological and conceptual approach to this repertoire. There are three main types of samples: structural samples, surface samples, and lyric samples. Each of these types has a distinct function in a sample-based track: structural samples create the rhythmic foundation, surface samples overlay or decorate the foundation, and lyric samples provide words or phrases of text.
The typology offers a consistent approach to identifying the sounds in sample-based music, allowing recognition of historical trends and generalization about musical style. For example, hip-hop producers have sampled lyrics from Public Enemy's 1987 "Bring the Noise" over 100 times, and those samples show striking similarities both in the material sampled (Flavor Flav's "yeah, boy" and Chuck D's "bass" are favorites) and how the sampled sounds are treated in new tracks. The typology is a way to differentiate producers' treatments of sampled sounds. Additionally, the typology is a tool for distinguishing the musical styles of artists. Released within a year of each other, Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet and the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique each contain over 100 samples. The typology offers a way to describe the groups' sampling styles. Further, while hip-hop artists and scholars agree that sampling changed after the 1991 lawsuit involving Biz Markie's "Alone Again," until now, there has been no way to quantify these changes. The typology is a concrete way to demonstrate how hip-hop groups such as The Beastie Boys, De La Soul, Public Enemy, Salt 'n' Pepa, and A Tribe Called Quest modified their approaches to sampling when samples became difficult to license. Ultimately, a typology is a systematic analytical approach to the genre of sample-based hip-hop.},

However, with increasing numbers of smart devices and improved hardware, there is interest in performing model training on the device. Given this surge in interest, a comprehensive survey of the field from a device-agnostic perspective sets the stage for both understanding the state of the art and for identifying open challenges and future avenues of research. However, on-device learning is an expansive field with connections to a large number of related topics in AI and machine learning (including online learning, model adaptation, one/few-shot learning, etc.). Hence, covering such a large number of topics in a single survey is impractical. This survey finds a middle ground by reformulating the problem of on-device learning as resource constrained learning where the resources are compute and memory. This reformulation allows tools, techniques, and algorithms from a wide variety of research areas to be compared equitably. In addition to summarizing the state of the art, the survey also identifies a number of challenges and next steps for both the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of on-device learning.},

In the broader context of large-scale machine learning, the concept of “data augmentation” — supplementing a training set with carefully perturbed samples — has emerged as an important component of robust systems. In this work, we develop a general software framework for augmenting annotated musical datasets, which will allow practitioners to easily expand training sets with musically motivated perturbations of both audio and annotations. As a proof of concept, we investigate the effects of data augmentation on the task of recognizing instruments in mixed signals.},

Here we aim to further explore the impact of complexity on aesthetic experiences in both visual and auditory domains. Twenty-eight college students were tasked with viewing pairs of abstract paintings by Ely Raman and indicating their preference using a two-alternative forced choice procedure. Following this, they listened to Western tonal music for five seconds and completed a simple choice reaction task. A longer reaction time was taken as an indication of greater immersion in the music and, consequently, a stronger preference. Our findings confirmed a preference for complexity in both visual and auditory modalities. Additionally, a notable correlation was observed between the inclination towards complexity in the visual domain and that in the auditory domain, lending support to the Taste Typicality in explaining individual differences in aesthetic experiences.},

Based on a thematic analysis the pictorial review presents the visual strategies under seven analytical themes: 1) composition, 2) typography, 3) colour, 4) drawing attention, 5) visual style, 6) active engagement, and 7) visual related work. The review focuses on strategies for communicating research visually, rather than the content and contribution of the reviewed pictorials. The review outlines both basic graphical principles, as well as novel use of visual elements. The pictorial is the first attempt at a visual analysis of the pictorial format, offering authors of future pictorials, both an overview of the development of the format, as well as inspiration for new ways to complement text with visual content. Lastly, the challenges and future potentials which emerged from the review are discussed.},

	abstract = {So far, NIME research has been mostly inward-looking, dedicated to divulging and studying our own work and having limited engagement with trends outside our community. Though musical instruments as cultural artefacts are inherently political, we have so far not suﬃciently engaged with confronting these themes in our own research. In this paper we argue that we should consider how our work is also political, and begin to develop a clear political agenda that includes social, ethical, and cultural considerations through which to consider not only our own musical instruments, but also those not created by us. Failing to do so would result in an unintentional but tacit acceptance and support of such ideologies. We explore one item to be included in this political agenda: the recent trend in music technology of “democratising music”, which carries implicit political ideologies grounded in techno-solutionism. We conclude with a number of recommendations for stimulating communitywide discussion on these themes in the hope that this leads to the development of an outward-facing perspective that fully engages with political topics.},

	abstract = {Mapping gestures to digital musical instrument parameters is not trivial when the dimensionality of the sensor-captured data is high and the model relating the gesture to sensor data is unknown. In these cases, a front-end processing system for extracting gestural information embedded in the sensor data is essential. In this paper we propose an unsupervised offline method that learns how to reduce and map the gestural data to a generic instrument parameter control space. We make an unconventional use of the Self-Organizing Maps to obtain only a geometrical transformation of the gestural data, while dimensionality reduction is handled separately. We introduce a novel training procedure to overcome two main SelfOrganizing Maps limitations which otherwise corrupt the interface usability. As evaluation, we apply this method to our existing Voice-Controlled Interface for musical instruments, obtaining sensible usability improvements.},

A sizable sequel appeared in 2014, Absolute Recoil: Towards a New Foundation of Dialectical Materialism. In these two books, Žižek returns to the German idealist G. W. F. Hegel in order to forge a new materialism for the twenty-first century. Žižek's reinvention of Hegelian dialectics explores perennial and contemporary concerns: humanity's relations with nature, the place of human freedom, the limits of rationality, the roles of spirituality and religion, and the prospects for radical sociopolitical change.In A New German Idealism, Adrian Johnston offers a first-of-its-kind sustained critical response to Less Than Nothing and Absolute Recoil. Johnston, a leading authority on and interlocutor of Žižek, assesses the recent return to Hegel against the backdrop of Kantian and post-Kantian German idealism. He also presents alternate reconstructions of Hegel's positions that differ in important respects from Žižek's version of dialectical materialism. In particular, Johnston criticizes Žižek's deviations from the secular naturalism and Enlightenment optimism of his chosen sources of inspiration: not only Hegel, but Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud too. In response, Johnston develops what he calls transcendental materialism, an antireductive and leftist materialism capable of preserving and advancing the core legacies of the Hegelian, Marxian, and Freudian traditions central to Žižek},

I allow the dancers’ voices to directly address this research, describing their own feelings about the potential for remote dance creation. They describe how these practices sit adjacent to, and in many ways are antagonistic to, professional disciplined modes of dance work. We then ask, can remote motion-captured dance be elevated to being a truly poetic mode of creative performance, or is it merely a tool for a kind of loosely directed dance play?},

	abstract = {Let's look beyond the impressive capabilities of current AI tools, to envision 'intelligent experiences' that can surprise and delight us, are culturally enriching, and are inclusive, fair and environmentally sound. 
Intelligent experiences are encounters with creative works infused with new and emerging technologies. They encompass sensory, emotional and intellectual engagement with various interfaces and artifacts powered by machine learning models. 
These experiences are where humans meaningfully engage with machine learning's predictive capabilities. They manifest the outputs of machine logic in forms that humans can understand and interact with. 
Crucially, intelligent experiences foster serendipitous, unexpected interactions rather than trying to replicate interactions learned from the past. This goes beyond efficiency, or mimicking the works of human artists. Intelligent experiences are celebrations of diverse interpretations and interactions, and mediators of constructive discussions rather than heated exchange. They provoke us to search for meaning and come to new interpretations of cultural works and ultimately of ourselves. 
The arts, like any other field, have a responsibility to use technologies responsibly, so we call for intelligent experiences to be not only delightful and enriching, but also socially and environmentally just. They need to express a multiplicity of data rights and ownership, and acknowledge and reward effortful human creative practice. 
For this to work, we need to ask questions of AI itself, and consider how the technology needs to evolve to make a lasting impact on human creativity. This vision for intelligent experiences will require AI to become more subjective, playful, able to deal with ambiguity, open to failure, improvised, negotiated, and being open to critique from those who engage with it. We believe intelligent experiences can help to radically change how we think about AI design, moving beyond the current paradigm of learning patterns from large amounts of data, to embrace human traits such as bias, disagreement, and uncertainty as a signal with creative potential rather than noise that needs to be removed.},

	abstract = {Many countries have implemented school closures due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has inevitably affected children's physical and mental health. It is vital for parents to pay special attention to their children's health status during school closures. However, it is difficult for parents to recognize the changes in their children's health, especially without visible symptoms, such as psychosocial functioning in mental health. Moreover, healthcare resources and understanding of the health and societal impact of COVID-19 are quite limited during the pandemic. Against this background, we collected real-world datasets from 1,172 children in Hong Kong during four time periods under different pandemic and school closure conditions from September 2019 to January 2022. Based on these data, we first perform exploratory data analysis to explore the impact of school closures on six health indicators, including physical activity intensity, physical functioning, self-rated health, psychosocial functioning, resilience, and connectedness. We further study the correlation between children's contextual characteristics (i.e., demographics, socioeconomic status, electronic device usage patterns, financial satisfaction, academic performance, sleep pattern, exercise habits, and dietary patterns) and the six health indicators. Subsequently, a health inference system is designed and developed to infer children's health status based on their contextual features to derive the risk factors of the six health indicators. The evaluation and case studies on real-world datasets show that this health inference system can help parents and authorities better understand key factors correlated with children's health status during school closures.},

	abstract = {Music can be seen as a social skilled practice, since the creation of good music is the result of a group effort. According to current literature, communication through non-verbal cues is an important factor in securing a good performance, since it allows musicians to correct each other without interruptions. Hence, despite the fact that the skill to engage in a non-verbal interaction is described as tacit knowledge, it is fundamental for both musicians and teachers (Davidson and Good 2002). Typical observed non-verbal cues are for example: physical gestures, modulations of sound, steady eye contact, and facial expressions (Levasseur 1994, Kurkul 1997). This meta-study proposes to investigate musicians’ interaction using the Belief-Desire-Intention model (Bratman 1999) that has been used in software development of planning agents (Rao and Georgeff 1995). According to Bratman, as planning agents, we act intentionally, and we form and execute (partial) plans. Future-directed intentions are further reconsidered according to the reduced set of desires and beliefs. In the BDI sense musicians interact to execute their plan, originated for instance by the desire to play good music, the belief of knowing how the music should be played and the intention to communicate through non-verbal interaction, which allows them to achieve their desire and improve the performance on-the-fly. The BDI model has proven useful in synthesising information and it is believed that this scientific-rational model will bring benefits in analysing a tacit practice.},

Our training strategy is suitable for unsupervised concept learning with much lesser parameter space requirements compared to baseline methods. Our proposed model also has provision for leveraging self-supervision on concepts to extract better explanations. However, with full concept supervision, we achieve the best predictive performance compared to recently proposed concept-based explainable models. We report both qualitative and quantitative results with our method, which shows better performance than recently proposed concept-based explainability methods. We reported exhaustive results with two datasets without ground truth concepts, i.e., CIFAR10, ImageNet, and two datasets with ground truth concepts, i.e., AwA2, CUB-200, to show the effectiveness of our method for both cases. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ante-hoc explanation generation method to show results with a large-scale dataset such as ImageNet.},

While medical encounters involve "micro-level" interactions between individuals, these interpersonal processes occur in a social context shaped by "macro-level" structures in society. Examining prior theories pertinent to medical discourse leads to the propositions: (a) that medical encounters tend to convey ideologic messages supportive of the current social order; (b) that these encounters have repercussions for social control; and (c) that medical language generally excludes a critical appraisal of the social context. The technical structure of the medical encounter, as traditionally seen by health professionals, masks a deeper structure that may have little to do with the conscious thoughts of professionals about what they are saying and doing. Similar patterns may appear in encounters between clients and members of other "helping" professions. Expressed marginally or conveyed by absence of criticism about contextual issues, ideology and social control in medical discourse remain largely unintentional mechanisms for achieving consent.},

Rather, it is probably an artefact of the conversational organization of interviews as tests. Analysis of Quality of Life assessment interviews show, we argue, that there is probably no uniform ‘acquiescent’ motivation which accounts for all inconsistencies and agreements that might be produced under such circumstances. Rather, the interview's logic produces a range of pseudo-acquiescent responses in the face of interviewers reformulations, and their pursuit of plausible and acceptable answers. There is also evidence of ‘anti-acquiescence’, in which respondents resist pressure to change their answers. We conclude that the traditional notion of submissive, willing-to-please acquiescence is probably unsustainable on current evidence, and ought to be replaced by a more respectful account of the linguistic and interpersonal competence of people with learning disabilities.},

Here we introduce a computational cognitive model of voice leading, intended both for analyzing voice-leading practices within encoded musical corpora and for generating new voice leadings for unseen chord sequences. This model is feature-based, quantifying the desirability of a given voice leading on the basis of different features derived from Huron’s (2001) perceptual account of voice leading. We use the model to analyze a corpus of 370 chorale harmonizations by J. S. Bach, and demonstrate the model’s application to the voicing of harmonic progressions in different musical genres. The model is implemented in a new R package, “voicer,” which we release alongside this paper.},

	abstract = {In mulsemedia applications, traditional media content (text, image, audio, video, etc.) can be related to media objects that target other human senses (e.g., smell, haptics, taste). Such applications aim at bridging the virtual and real worlds through sensors and actuators. Actuators are responsible for the execution of sensory effects (e.g., wind, heat, light), which produce sensory stimulations on the users. In these applications sensory stimulation must happen in a timely manner regarding the other traditional media content being presented. For example, at the moment in which an explosion is presented in the audiovisual content, it may be adequate to activate actuators that produce heat and light. It is common to use some declarative multimedia authoring language to relate the timestamp in which each media object is to be presented to the execution of some sensory effect. One problem in this setting is that the synchronization of media objects and sensory effects is done manually by the author(s) of the application, a process which is time-consuming and error prone. In this paper, we present a bimodal neural network architecture to assist the synchronization task in mulsemedia applications. Our approach is based on the idea that audio and video signals can be used simultaneously to identify the timestamps in which some sensory effect should be executed. Our learning architecture combines audio and video signals for the prediction of scene components. For evaluation purposes, we construct a dataset based on Google's AudioSet. We provide experiments to validate our bimodal architecture. Our results show that the bimodal approach produces better results when compared to several variants of unimodal architectures.},

	abstract = {Motion capture technologies reconstruct human movements and have wide-ranging applications. Mainstream research on motion capture can be divided into vision-based methods and inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods. The vision-based methods capture complex 3D geometrical deformations with high accuracy, but they rely on expensive optical equipment and suffer from the line-of-sight occlusion problem. IMU-based methods are lightweight but hard to capture fine-grained 3D deformations. In this work, we present a configurable self-sensing IMU sensor network to bridge the gap between the vision-based and IMU-based methods. To achieve this, we propose a novel kinematic chain model based on the four-bar linkage to describe the minimum deformation process of 3D deformations. We also introduce three geometric priors, obtained from the initial shape, material properties and motion features, to assist the kinematic chain model in reconstructing deformations and overcome the data sparsity problem. Additionally, to further enhance the accuracy of deformation capture, we propose a fabrication method to customize 3D sensor networks for different objects. We introduce origami-inspired thinking to achieve the customization process, which constructs 3D sensor networks through a 3D-2D-3D digital-physical transition. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {This chapter is about getting familiar with the data. Knowledge about the data is useful for data preprocessing, the first major task of the data mining process. The various attribute types are studied. These include nominal attributes, binary attributes, ordinal attributes, and numeric attributes. Basic statistical descriptions can be used to learn more about each attribute's values. Given a temperature attribute, one can determine its mean (average value), median (middle value), and mode (most common value). These are measures of central tendency, which give us an idea of the “middle” or center of distribution. Knowing such basic statistics regarding each attribute makes it easier to fill in missing values, smooth noisy values, and spot outliers during data preprocessing. Knowledge of the attributes and attribute values can also help in fixing inconsistencies incurred during data integration. Plotting the measures of central tendency shows us if the data are symmetric or skewed. Quantile plots, histograms, and scatter plots are other graphic displays of basic statistical descriptions. These can all be useful during data preprocessing and can provide insight into areas for mining. The field of data visualization provides many additional techniques for viewing data through graphical means. These can help identify relations, trends, and biases “hidden” in unstructured data sets. The similarity/dissimilarity between objects may also be used to detect outliers in the data, or to perform nearest-neighbor classification. There are many measures for assessing similarity and dissimilarity. In general, such measures are referred to as proximity measures.},

	abstract = {This is Cage's famous silent piece. Although composed in 1952, he had already thought about it as early as 1948, where he mentions it as 'Silent Prayer' in his article “A Composer's Confessions”. In the work, no intentional sounds are made during its duration. The first version of the work contains 3 movements lasting 33", 2'40" and 1'20", each chance determined. Later on Cage reworked the piece, creating a wholly different composition from the original. Much has been written about 4'33" and about Cage's ideas behind its silence. Two of the most prevalent ideas are that 1. Silence does not exist. One simply should listen and open one's ears. 2. Silence is a means to separate tones and chords, in order to avoid melodic interpretations to the relationships between and among sounds. However, according to David Tudor, as quoted in interview materials contained in Peter Dickinson’s Cage Talk (2006) 4’33” was for Cage a simple and quite natural extension of his use of chance operations applied to sounds and silences in composition, with silences, in this case, comprising the entire gamut of materials at his disposal.},

It argues that the two technologies developed in complementary, dialectical relation to each other: one analog, storing and conveying an acoustic event (i.e., sound-in-time); the other, digital, storing and conveying in binary form information for (re)producing sound (i.e., sound-in-knowledge). Analyzing the production of sound along the same lines as Harry Braverman's analysis of manufacturing and automation, the article treats the phonograph and the player-piano as aspects of musical mechanization, which had expanded dramatically through the piano in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Both the phonograph and player-piano technologies reverberated in the formation of modern society, the phonograph exemplifying the phenomenological rupture of time and space, the player-piano embodying the epistemological shift marked by machines storing and executing growing amounts of human knowledge, from automated industrial manufacturing to computers. The final section of the article considers the malign and utopian symbolism of the player-piano in the work of William Gaddis and Conlon Nancarrow, among other other writers and composers.},

	abstract = {Digital technology has undoubtedly influenced the way we create art today. The digital era gives us an unprecedented range of tools for making art and myriad art forms for expression, constituting a distinct aesthetic form. Furthermore, the new technology brought in new media that challenged the conventional notion of medium, artwork, artist, and audience and exerted a critical influence on the old, non-technological media, such as painting, drawing, sculpture, etc. The traditional media has been altered through hybridization and media convergence, most recently reaching the state of post-media condition. But we should remember that ours is not the first era in which technological advancements have led to a new state of art practice. The discovery of oil paints and the sfumato technique, and the linear perspective system in 15th century Europe formed the pictorial ideals for painting and drawing and, to a great extent, contributed to the Renaissance idea about human reason and power. Photography also generated a revolution in the art world. It was not only a new medium for artistic expression, but it changed the way image is perceived, challenging the detailed realism and conventional approach in the treatment of form and space in Western art. The work investigates similar ideas and sensibilities between the Renaissance, the discovery of photography, and the digital revolution, particularly relevant to the importance of technological advancements in artistic revolutions.},

Already, business leaders have begun replacing human artistic labour with AI-generated images. In response, the artistic community has launched a protest movement, which argues that AI image generation is a kind of theft. This paper analyzes, substantiates, and critiques these arguments, concluding that AI image generators involve an unethical kind of labour theft.

Not unexpectedly, a number of challenges and questions have arisen along with a significant tension related to the nature of user involvement in the design process. This project adopted an approach informed by participatory design where musicians became integral to the design process. Through this process a deeper understanding of the needs of musicians beyond usability considerations was developed.

Designers first analyze their own scenarios or storyboards with respect to concrete examples drawn from five socio-technical principles: situated action, rhythms \& routines, co-adaptive systems, peripheral awareness and distributed cognition. They then walk through the scenario and brainstorm new design alternatives that reflect the design principle in question. This combination of structured walkthroughs with focused brainstorming helps designers, particularly those with little social science background, to generate concrete, actionable ideas that reflect key findings from the social science literature. We taught Generative Walkthroughs in ten courses with over 220 students and found that technically-trained students not only learned these socio-technical principles, but were able to apply them in innovative ways in a variety of design settings.},

We are interested in expanding and formalizing this research approach, and understanding how knowledge, or theory, is generated from this type of design research. We conducted interviews with 12 leading HCI design researchers, asking them about design research, design theory, and RtD specifically. They were easily able to identify different types of design research and design theory from contemporary and historical design research efforts, and believed that RtD might be one of the most important contributions of design researchers to the larger research community. We further examined three historical RtD projects that were repeatedly mentioned in the interviews, and performed a critique of current RtD practices within the HCI research and interaction design communities. While our critique summarizes the problems, it also shows possible directions for further developments and refinements of the approach.},

In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},

However, there are currently no guidelines that describe how to apply this theory in design practice. Taking a research through design approach, I made many different products with the goal of helping people become the person they desire to be through their product interactions. Then, in order to better understand how the different design teams applied attachment theory, I created a set of design patterns that document the application of product attachment theory to the interaction design of each product. I clustered the patterns based on similarities across the different artifacts, and this produced six framing constructs, which work as specific perspectives designers can take when applying product attachment theory in an experience design project.},

Usually, designers focus on arranging methods and tools to support participants' ideation and expression trying to overcome the barriers resulting from differences in background, skills, attitudes, and expertise (Sanders and Stappers 2012). However, acting as facilitators or team leaders without specific training on individual and group dynamics can lead to overlooking tacit or latent aspects that can eventually drag the team into tiresome quicksand during the sessions. Methods: interpretive concepts and theories describing individual transformation processes in the context of small groups are taken from relevant literature in the field of management development and applied psychology. Results: a light conceptual framework spots five critical areas that professional designers need to pay attention to when planning and conducting a co-design activity, if they want to keep the participation and involvement alive: (1) Motivation; (2) Focus; (3) Boundaries; (4) Rumination; (5) Transformation. Conclusion: An area for further research and theory ground for group-based co-design practice is outlined.},

The relational framework affords defining Eating Disorders as multidimensional and mediated practices, which allows seeing healing as a process with material and spatial consistencies. The paper introduces the methodology generated to develop the model: an assemblage of methods organized through a multi-phase study that produces an inclusive and materially distributed understanding of EDs and recovery. The first model iteration emerges from the analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews with participants who successfully recovered from Eating Disorders. The paper describes the model through its actions, elements, layers, and its main aim: to produce pragmatic, evocative, and unconventional design propositions, tackling the relationships Eating Disorders are composed of that allow for a new sense of self to emerge as a new way to negotiate one's life.},

	abstract = {Outcomes, which are the result state or condition from a process or intervention, are essential elements of healthcare system design and an important indicator of performance. They are included in well-known system analysis frameworks such as the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) and Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA). However, fewer practical approaches exist for understanding and communicating interactions among healthcare outcomes. This study applies a novel mapping method as a practical approach to collect, aggregate and visualise interrelations among multiple healthcare outcomes. Graphic facilitation mapping sessions with eleven healthcare providers and ten patients with chronic conditions were conducted. Participants created outcome interrelationship maps following a six-step process. Two outcome-based network visualisations were synthesised using network analysis. This outcome-based approach advances how we frame healthcare systems, focussing on accommodating multiple stakeholders' visions, understanding interrelations, and defining trade-offs. This practical approach may complement frameworks such as SEIPS and CWA. Practitioner summary: The presented outcome-based mapping approach can facilitate the understanding of outcomes as part of the interrelated healthcare system. The approach allows the discussion and integration of different stakeholders' outcome priorities to identify critical elements and better inform the development or adaptation of healthcare systems.

	shorttitle = {Healthcare systems design},
	abstract = {This thesis investigates the role of healthcare outcomes {\textless}em{\textgreater}as a system {\textless}/em{\textgreater}to be applied in the (re)design of healthcare systems, notably in the context of long-term conditions. A participatory mapping outcome based approach that facilitates a space for multiple stakeholder negotiation has been developed to explore this phenomena following the four stages of the Design Research Methodology (DRM). Despite the growing recognition that outcomes in healthcare systems-level interventions rarely perform in an expected way and emerge from multiple and interrelated elements, there is little support concerning the understanding of multiple outcomes interrelations and their practical application in the systems (re)design process. Moreover, perspectives from multiple stakeholders are required to build a holistic understanding of healthcare outcomes. However, working with such heterogeneous groups bring extra challenges due to the multiple and frequently conflicting views about outcomes, values and purposes. Given this situation, facilitating the understanding of outcomes `as a system' whilst they are negotiated in an equitable space in necessary. In the first stage of DRM, the outcome-based approach was conceptually defined and initially applied with the design and human factors community. The approach was then refined in the second and third stages through one-to-one and participatory mapping sessions with people living with long-term conditions, senior managers and commissioners. The last stage concludes with a preliminary evaluation with design academics and practitioners. The research resulted in an outcome-based approach that i) proposes a reconceptualisation of healthcare outcomes and ii) offers a practical {\textless}em{\textgreater}dialogical mapping method {\textless}/em{\textgreater}to understand and negotiate outcomes with multiple stakeholders. Firstly, the reconceptualisation acknowledges that outcomes are value-dependent, continuous adaptable and may not respond to the short/long term structure. The bespoke network analysis accompanying the approach reveals tacit knowledge about outcomes 'as a system' that guides the identification of critical outcomes that can create propagation or become brokers. Furthermore, it identifies implications of considering wellbeing as the {\textless}em{\textgreater}system's purpose{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, which may require positive feedback and allow interaction with the system without exacerbation. Finally, the clarified role of values enriches participation (complexity sampling) and agrees upon high-level commitments. Secondly, the mapping method discards imposing a visual structure and instead combines an open mapping strategy with outcome representations. This method encourages stakeholders to freely make sense of their priorities and negotiate their conflicts, trade-offs and enduring needs whilst balancing the power dynamics of participation. This research has contributed to offering a new perspective on the role of outcomes for the (re)design of healthcare systems and providing practical applications that can encourage their integration.},

It supports a holistic application of co-design across all stages of a project, from the initial scoping and key ideation phases to beyond project completion. The model was iteratively developed through the design of inclusionED, a nationwide learning and teaching community-based platform aiming to implement research findings of the Autism CRC in schools across Australia. Within this project, multiple stakeholder groups, including teachers, specialist educators, students on the autism spectrum, parents, and policy-makers, were engaged throughout the design process and in ongoing resource development. The integrated co-design model provides a series of strategies for multiple stakeholder group engagement and participation, including methods for designing for co-design, facilitating blended co-design, applying asynchronous co-design, and working with participants requiring customised collaborative experiences to support their involvement, including co-designing with people with cognitive difficulties and trauma.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We propose that the Somaesthetic Appreciation designs share a subtleness in how they encourage and spur bodily inquiry in their choice of interaction modalities, they require an intimate correspondence – feedback and interactions that follow the rhythm of the body, they entail a distinct manner of making space shutting out the outside world – metaphorically and literally – to allow users to turn their attention inwards, and they rely on articulation of bodily experiences to encourage learning and increased somatic awareness.},

I apply an experimental approach of research through design, analysed from an interpretive point of view to prove a grounded theory. The paper starts from a prosthesis development presented as a tangible pragmatic procedure. The purpose of the case study is the notion of care through practical design that is marked with concern since the probability of harm can be incised by pure design decisions. Instead of describing the politics of roles and ethics in a situation characterised by `design for care' inspirations, I use reflection on design practice to understand embodied thoughts concerning relationships and the ways of doing. In the second part of the paper, I proceed with literature review in disability research and parallel design strategies. In the final section – in relation to co-design – I introduce the term of `co-Ability' that is rooted in the critical approach of posthuman disability studies outlined by scholars such as Rosi Braidotti. It serves as a broad umbrella term under which we can reconsider the potentials of various entities (biological and artificial) enhancing the shared competence rather than dwelling on the oppressive nature of human-centred norms. Overall, I suggest that the dominant normative vision manifesting in societal challenges is in relational matter with multiple body representations.},

Patient empowerment in chronic condition care has been gaining attention as a way of increasing the quality of life of patients and sustaining the limited resources of healthcare services. Design has the potential to facilitate empowerment through the designed products and services, yet how this can be achieved has not been explored. In this paper, we investigate empowerment from the patient's perspective and present design guidelines to facilitate empowerment. A design research approach was followed utilising design probes. Research methods include observation, interview, cultural probe and co-making workshop. The study was conducted with people living with a chronic condition called lymphoedema and their healthcare providers. This study presents that, patient empowerment is beyond increased power in decision-making, and is associated with everyday life with its competing priorities and un-prescribed adaptations to self-management. We propose that an individual's readiness for empowerment should be considered to provide the right support at the right time for the patient. In this study, the rich everyday chronic condition experiences are transferred into design guidelines to contribute to the development of future self-management support.},

	abstract = {We propose MusicRL, the first music generation system finetuned from human feedback. Appreciation of text-to-music models is particularly subjective since the concept of musicality as well as the specific intention behind a caption are user-dependent (e.g. a caption such as "upbeat work-out music" can map to a retro guitar solo or a techno pop beat). Not only this makes supervised training of such models challenging, but it also calls for integrating continuous human feedback in their post-deployment finetuning. MusicRL is a pretrained autoregressive MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) model of discrete audio tokens finetuned with reinforcement learning to maximise sequence-level rewards. We design reward functions related specifically to text-adherence and audio quality with the help from selected raters, and use those to finetune MusicLM into MusicRL-R. We deploy MusicLM to users and collect a substantial dataset comprising 300,000 pairwise preferences. Using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), we train MusicRL-U, the first text-to-music model that incorporates human feedback at scale. Human evaluations show that both MusicRL-R and MusicRL-U are preferred to the baseline. Ultimately, MusicRL-RU combines the two approaches and results in the best model according to human raters. Ablation studies shed light on the musical attributes influencing human preferences, indicating that text adherence and quality only account for a part of it. This underscores the prevalence of subjectivity in musical appreciation and calls for further involvement of human listeners in the finetuning of music generation models.},

To answer these questions, we adopted a co/auto-ethnographic and Research-through-Design approach to reflexively engage with our design decisions, outcomes, and challenges related to two virtual co-design workshops. We constructed a set of four multi-dimensional facets(Rhythms of Engagement, Material Engagement, Ludic Engagement, and Conceptual Achievement) and three roles (designer, researcher, facilitator) to consider when creating co-design experiences.

We used participatory action research to co-design an innovative, interprofessional simulation based on `real world' clinical incidents and lived experiences to improve the delivery of safe, high quality, consumer-focused healthcare. Following ethics approval, content analysis of serious adverse patient safety events involving cognitive bias was conducted. These data informed audio-recorded interviews with the healthcare workforce and consumers to explore their experiences of cognitive bias. Following thematic analysis, key themes of communication, stigma, diagnostic overshadowing, and fragmented systems were uncovered. Guided by consumers, these themes were interwoven into a simulation scenario that included real places, stories, and verbatim quotes delivered through mixed media artefacts. This heightened the immersive and experiential learning that aimed to uncover unconscious bias and help learners recognise its impact on clinical decisions and practice. To our knowledge, this is the first interprofessional, co-designed simulation to specifically address cognitive bias in current and future healthcare workforce. Plans to translate this research into a practical framework on how to work with key stakeholders (including consumers) to identify `real-world' health service risks and co-design targeted simulations to address these gaps are described, including lessons learned.},

	abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) has a strong tradition in professional settings, including e.g. hospitals and nursing homes. As care and rehabilitation practices move, to a greater extent, out of the hospitals and into private homes a new take on PD is needed to facilitate design activities with patients or laypeople as the primary user groups and to design healthcare applications to be used primarily in the home. This paper discusses challenges and possibilities related to the design of home-based healthcare applications and especially the users' possibilities for participation in creative PD activities. Based upon ongoing design-work, related to home-based rehabilitation of elderly suffering from vestibular dysfunction (dizziness), this paper presents lessons learned and initial outcomes related to patient/citizen-focused development of healthcare solutions for private homes. We present initial ideas on how PD can be used to develop pervasive healthcare applications with less resourceful user-groups such as elderly people suffering from illness.},
